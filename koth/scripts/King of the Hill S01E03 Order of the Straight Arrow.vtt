WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:08.093
Hey, me and Dale are taking Bobby's troop up by the lake for order of the straight arrow this weekend.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.436
Y'all want to come for old time's sake?

00:10.456 --> 00:11.538
Well, of course I'll go.

00:11.558 --> 00:14.863
I'll never miss an order of the straight arrow.

00:15.745 --> 00:16.706
Not since ours.

00:17.107 --> 00:19.430
Yeah, ours was something special.

00:20.492 --> 00:21.754
Now for the final test.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.296
The snipe hunt.

00:23.677 --> 00:24.598
Not gonna sugarcoat it.

00:24.999 --> 00:27.523
Some of you ain't coming back.

00:27.858 --> 00:32.064
Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era.

00:32.084 --> 00:33.986
Those who don't, will be dead.

00:35.248 --> 00:36.530
Question.

00:36.550 --> 00:37.110
Are you ready?

00:37.371 --> 00:38.492
Yeah!

00:41.597 --> 00:45.161
If you want the test of silence, useless, give me a silent stick.

00:48.105 --> 00:51.430
For the rest of your long, miserable life, you will carry the scar of failure.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.072
Now go give me a beer.

00:55.533 --> 00:59.240
And you boys get out there and bag some snipe!

01:03.228 --> 01:03.769
Snipe!

01:03.989 --> 01:04.771
Shut up, Dale.

01:04.991 --> 01:05.913
There is no snipe.

01:05.953 --> 01:07.496
I heard my dad talking to your dad.

01:07.757 --> 01:08.959
So what are we doing out here?

01:09.440 --> 01:11.384
We're going to get snackered, I tell you what, boy, man.

01:11.424 --> 01:17.355
I want to get all messed up and just pollute our minds out of three sheets of dang old wind, man.

01:20.491 --> 01:27.763
I grew up I'm gonna drink this stuff every day just like my dad and fly jets and maybe even be an astronaut.

01:27.984 --> 01:31.550
I'm gonna live in London and be a rich millionaire and have people killed.

01:33.092 --> 01:37.660
I'm gonna sell propane and propane accessories if my grades are good enough.

01:40.945 --> 01:42.788
Oh kids and their crazy dreams.

01:44.652 --> 01:46.735
I'm so depressed I can't even blink.

02:18.035 --> 02:22.701
Well, we're gonna make some men out of those twelve-year-old boys tomorrow, I tell you what.

02:23.002 --> 02:25.224
Well, we still get to play practical jokes, right?

02:25.685 --> 02:27.007
They're not jokes, Bill.

02:27.287 --> 02:28.529
They're painful lessons.

02:28.969 --> 02:31.713
I thank my father for all the tricks he played on me.

02:32.234 --> 02:35.037
He taught me the most wonderful lesson a child can learn.

02:35.718 --> 02:37.080
Never trust nobody.

02:38.682 --> 02:41.646
That's how I know Bob Dole's faking that dead arm.

02:41.761 --> 02:45.746
I tell you what you do, man, I don't even know how to handle a water trick that's gonna work every time, man.

02:45.766 --> 02:52.514
You just put it in a water like that, and it don't, it's, they spend a whole dadgum day like that cleaning up that dang old pee-pee.

02:52.534 --> 02:54.376
Yeah, but those are getting tired.

02:54.756 --> 02:56.078
We need some new material.

02:56.578 --> 02:59.522
Dad, can me and Bobby bring a life preservers?

02:59.962 --> 03:03.246
If you want to be sissies... He said yes!

03:03.648 --> 03:07.095
Hey, Dale, uh, there's your wife's, uh... Healer.

03:07.435 --> 03:10.802
Yeah, John Redcorn, let's get some funny Indian stuff to do.

03:11.143 --> 03:12.626
Hey, John Redcorn!

03:13.087 --> 03:15.631
Hank, Dale, Bill, Whomhower.

03:16.072 --> 03:22.645
John Redcorn, we've got this order of the straight arrow retreat tomorrow, and I was wondering... I'd be honored to look after your wife.

03:25.932 --> 03:26.112
Oh!

03:26.581 --> 03:28.445
Well, gee, thanks.

03:28.465 --> 03:34.039
But what I was really wondering is if you had some good Indian stuff for the ceremony around the campfire.

03:34.921 --> 03:39.291
Hmm, our rituals are considered sacred and are passed down only in the nation.

03:39.311 --> 03:40.674
Oh well, that don't bother us.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.020
Hell no, we'll take a sacred one.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.088
There is a very ancient ceremony I learned from my grandfather.

03:46.710 --> 03:51.563
We call upon the sacred Wimatenya, and we ask him to breathe life into our spirit bag.

03:51.964 --> 03:56.716
See, spirit bags, Wimatenya, funny looking headband.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.203
Oh, the boys are going to eat this stuff up.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.942
The spirit bag is very sacred.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.484
You should not make light.

04:05.447 --> 04:07.269
I like how you say everything's sacred.

04:07.329 --> 04:08.250
That's funny too.

04:08.751 --> 04:09.752
Let's do that, Hank.

04:10.192 --> 04:13.056
I got a bunch of ladies tennis socks we can use for spirit bags.

04:14.037 --> 04:15.058
I got them in a divorce.

04:15.699 --> 04:17.741
Now, every time she plays, she gets blisters.

04:18.662 --> 04:20.264
It's been six years, Bill.

04:20.304 --> 04:23.368
Don't you think she'd have bought some new socks by now?

04:23.770 --> 04:26.436
I want to get that straight arrow patch so bad.

04:26.476 --> 04:30.565
I'm going to put it right here next to my sewing patch.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.709
It's supposed to be hard.

04:33.291 --> 04:37.560
I heard they make you walk on hot coals and then you have to eat them.

04:38.462 --> 04:38.522
Ew!

04:39.083 --> 04:40.446
After you walk on them?

04:41.928 --> 04:44.932
Hell, that's hot!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.655
Hell, you're not kidding!

04:46.975 --> 04:47.496
Fuck!

04:47.516 --> 04:48.217
Hardone, mate!

04:48.257 --> 04:50.040
Did I just hear what I almost heard?

04:50.060 --> 04:53.985
I was gonna say... Fuuuugget about it!

04:54.506 --> 04:57.571
Son, Peggy Hill knows half a swear word when she hears one.

04:58.011 --> 04:58.752
Can I go to sleep?

05:00.194 --> 05:01.717
You had the coolest mom.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.360
She smells like Miracle Whip.

05:06.123 --> 05:06.644
Hey, guys.

05:07.245 --> 05:08.106
Hey, Eustace.

05:08.126 --> 05:09.047
Hey, Eustace.

05:11.371 --> 05:11.631
Hey, Eustace.

05:12.556 --> 05:13.237
All right, Randy.

05:13.878 --> 05:16.041
Remember, the purpose of this weekend is to have fun.

05:16.882 --> 05:19.987
Daddy loves you whether you get your straight arrow patch or not.

05:21.088 --> 05:21.769
What a load.

05:22.210 --> 05:26.135
Can you imagine how I'd have turned out if my dad had loved me no matter what?

05:26.155 --> 05:27.778
Thanks for the bus fare, Aunt Peggy.

05:28.058 --> 05:28.819
Don't be silly, honey.

05:28.839 --> 05:30.722
It is very important that you be there for your mama.

05:31.183 --> 05:31.984
This is her big day.

05:32.224 --> 05:35.429
Well, actually, her big day is a sentencing.

05:35.489 --> 05:36.711
This is just the arrangement.

05:37.191 --> 05:37.992
Here's a fun saver.

05:38.052 --> 05:39.154
Take lots of pictures.

05:45.057 --> 05:46.138
There we go.

05:46.158 --> 05:46.899
Have a good time.

05:47.219 --> 05:48.080
Here's a fun saver.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.181
Take lots of pictures.

05:49.521 --> 05:53.605
Gosh, Pig, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were anxious to see us go.

05:54.206 --> 05:56.428
Well, that is not true.

05:56.908 --> 05:58.490
You and Bobby are my whole life.

05:58.890 --> 05:59.811
Come on, kids!

05:59.831 --> 06:00.332
Let's go!

06:00.832 --> 06:01.913
Everybody in the car!

06:01.933 --> 06:02.794
I'm the light now!

06:03.074 --> 06:03.975
Hold on, boys.

06:04.516 --> 06:12.263
Before we go, we have to ask the Great Spirit, uh, Wumatanya, to watch over us on this trip.

06:12.428 --> 06:19.377
This trip is about the sacredness of Mother Earth and all she gives us.

06:20.058 --> 06:23.141
So pee now, because once we're on the road, we ain't stopping.

06:25.284 --> 06:26.546
I'll see you Sunday, pig.

06:26.606 --> 06:27.246
Okay.

06:27.287 --> 06:27.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:27.687 --> 06:27.927
All right.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.370
Bye-bye.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.072
Oh, damn it.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.095
Looks like we're delayed a couple hours.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.339
I gotta charge up the battery.

06:38.939 --> 06:57.457
Drop the clutch on!

06:57.477 --> 06:58.318
We metanye!

06:58.779 --> 07:00.660
Let's spot license plates.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.922
I see Texas, we metanye!

07:02.062 --> 07:03.924
We metanye, there's another Texas, we metanye!

07:03.964 --> 07:07.427
We metanye, I see Texas, we metanye!

07:07.981 --> 07:10.766
Wimitanyay, Texas, Wimitanyay.

07:11.227 --> 07:13.591
What you guys just shut up?

07:13.611 --> 07:15.374
You didn't say Wimitanyay!

07:16.777 --> 07:17.859
Boom, Howard, pass them.

07:17.879 --> 07:18.640
I got an idea.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.281
Pass them up.

07:19.301 --> 07:21.185
Wimitanyay, ask Mr. Gribble's butt, Wimitanyay.

07:21.205 --> 07:31.423
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in,

07:32.838 --> 07:34.860
I see Texas, we matane!

07:34.880 --> 07:36.021
All right, that's it.

07:36.662 --> 07:38.203
Everybody pile out right now.

07:39.925 --> 07:43.329
Okay, the 24-hour oath of silence starts now.

07:43.989 --> 07:45.631
Hear your silence sticks.

07:45.651 --> 07:46.732
Those are slim jeans.

07:47.132 --> 07:48.934
That's what the white man calls them.

07:49.575 --> 07:53.739
When matanya calls them silent sticks to test your spirit of shutting up.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.382
Each time you talk, I take a bite.

07:57.022 --> 07:58.644
Talk five times and you're out.

07:58.664 --> 08:01.647
24-hour silence starting now.

08:07.685 --> 08:08.346
Right now?

08:08.946 --> 08:10.708
Bobby, son, you just talked.

08:11.248 --> 08:13.351
Now, I'll let that pass, but don't talk again.

08:13.391 --> 08:15.753
Thanks, Dad.

08:17.094 --> 08:19.216
Son, give me that slim, Jim.

08:32.529 --> 08:34.351
I'm hungry.

08:34.371 --> 08:35.312
No problem.

08:41.165 --> 08:41.425
Ha!

08:42.026 --> 08:42.808
That was a test.

08:43.388 --> 08:46.453
Joseph, give Mr. Dothrieve a bite of your silent stick.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.738
Remember kids, you never know when you're going to be tested.

08:51.441 --> 08:52.582
Now who else is hungry?

08:52.923 --> 08:53.564
I am!

08:53.584 --> 08:53.985
Gotcha!

08:54.566 --> 08:58.171
Bobby, Randy, Garth, pass your silent sticks up.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.076
See kids, it's harder than you think.

09:01.937 --> 09:04.140
You don't want to end up like Randy's dad.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.684
My dad's a successful patent lawyer.

09:07.065 --> 09:09.248
Not in the eyes of Wumitanya.

09:11.270 --> 09:12.231
I'm still hungry.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.795
Who wants a dollar, say me?

09:14.815 --> 09:15.176
Me!

09:18.681 --> 09:20.043
Well, these things are addictive.

09:20.824 --> 09:22.586
Lord Bobby, watch out, son.

09:23.027 --> 09:24.950
You've lost more chores than anybody.

09:25.430 --> 09:30.958
Now don't talk, no matter what.

09:30.978 --> 09:32.741
But, Matanya, Mr. Gripple's not wearing his seat belt.

09:32.801 --> 09:35.304
Bobby, you just got four in a row.

09:35.425 --> 09:37.868
One more bite and you can't make straight arrow.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.227
I'll take that jerky now.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.674
Here it is, boys, the great outdoors.

09:52.662 --> 09:59.551
Thanks to our efforts, we have preserved the nesting areas for the Texas spotted owl, the snail darter, and the endangered whooping crane.

10:00.091 --> 10:03.636
And we eliminated 300 logging jobs.

10:06.923 --> 10:11.591
Also, this note people, the brown herbal ecstasy is bad.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.537
Do not, I repeat, do not take the brown herbal ecstasy.

10:15.797 --> 10:16.538
Thank you all.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.986
Oh man, what kind of lefty hootenanny is this?

10:21.687 --> 10:25.313
Look at that one bouncing around in front of God and everybody.

10:26.054 --> 10:28.678
Would it kill a tree if she wore a bra?

10:40.505 --> 10:51.400
I'm beginning to think this silence thing is just so we don't bother them.

10:51.581 --> 10:54.024
They're not testing anything except for how dumb we are.

10:54.665 --> 10:55.506
It's a whole trick.

10:55.726 --> 10:57.048
My dad wouldn't trick us!

11:01.154 --> 11:03.097
My dad wouldn't trick us.

11:07.203 --> 11:08.925
We want to donate!

11:12.753 --> 11:15.637
Wematanye, who wants another beer, Wematanye?

11:20.884 --> 11:22.446
I am kicking elk.

11:22.466 --> 11:26.832
As long as the sacred fire is burning, the oath of silence is suspended.

11:28.475 --> 11:29.396
Take the log.

11:29.416 --> 11:30.998
Shut up, I'm talking here.

11:31.805 --> 11:47.722
We of the Order of the Straight Arrow, call upon the spirit Wematane, protector of the sacred ground, that brings us cool water to drink, and energy efficient, clean, burning, propane gas for all our sacred heating and cooking needs.

11:48.223 --> 11:50.585
Wematane says, respect the earth.

11:51.186 --> 11:53.589
She's ours by God, our tax is paid for.

11:53.649 --> 11:57.753
Also, it says here, you gotta love all her creatures.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.755
Uh, let's see.

12:00.456 --> 12:01.457
Oh, here we go.

12:01.859 --> 12:10.469
Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you're going to recommend us to the spirit in the sky, with liberty and justice for all.

12:11.150 --> 12:14.234
Womitanya is with you, and with Texas.

12:14.855 --> 12:15.275
Amen.

12:15.856 --> 12:20.822
Amen.

12:20.842 --> 12:21.843
I'd like a room, please.

12:23.606 --> 12:27.310
I am Senora Groscha, Ibanez, and I will be paying in cash.

12:28.302 --> 12:31.747
Now we will say the oath of the order of the straight arrow.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.752
A straight arrow tells the truth.

12:35.974 --> 12:37.997
A straight arrow loves nature.

12:38.638 --> 12:47.031
A straight arrow is against Bill H.R.B.D.7 to allow the importation of South American propane.

12:47.452 --> 12:48.814
We must turn it.

12:49.355 --> 12:52.740
And now for the final test, the snipe hunt.

12:53.193 --> 12:57.701
You are about to come face to face with the deadliest beast in creation.

12:58.382 --> 13:05.274
Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era, and those who don't will be dead.

13:05.314 --> 13:09.842
Oh, Wematanie, protect us on our hunt.

13:10.643 --> 13:15.972
All right, this here's your whoop-ass stick to beat the snipe back in case he comes at you.

13:15.992 --> 13:17.715
Well, what does a snipe look like?

13:17.780 --> 13:25.112
It's got red glowing eyes, long crooked teeth, a claw and a tail with another claw in the end.

13:26.594 --> 13:27.175
Easy, Dale.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.239
Bill and I'll take the lead.

13:29.299 --> 13:31.202
Boom, Hauer and Dale will bring up the rear.

13:31.803 --> 13:33.946
Remember, the snap call is this.

13:34.627 --> 13:37.152
Woo-loo-loo, woo-loo-loo.

13:38.514 --> 13:39.656
Well, call him out, boys.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.138
He's not just gonna show up.

13:44.594 --> 14:08.188
got here look out Billy almost got you they'll be out there another hour then we'll go get them boy this takes me back what are you talking about

14:11.797 --> 14:14.628
Oh my lord, that's a whooping crane.

14:14.668 --> 14:18.021
There's only five of those left in the world.

14:18.081 --> 14:19.868
Well, four now.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.920
Then we should be thankful we got the opportunity to see one.

14:28.182 --> 14:29.344
Now you done it.

14:29.804 --> 14:32.067
Now you really gone and done it.

14:32.227 --> 14:33.189
What do you mean, you?

14:33.269 --> 14:34.611
We're all in this together.

14:34.851 --> 14:35.692
Whoa, no.

14:36.093 --> 14:40.398
Me and Boomhauer came on our own trip in our own conveyance.

14:40.418 --> 14:43.803
You and I may be acquainted, but we are not traveling companions.

14:44.524 --> 14:48.068
I'm merely here to enjoy Earth Day and play some hacky sack.

14:48.609 --> 14:51.473
Dale, I'm gonna need you to give me the keys now.

14:55.030 --> 14:56.131
I can't believe it.

14:56.171 --> 14:58.033
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

14:58.534 --> 14:59.635
You thought it was a snipe.

15:00.055 --> 15:00.836
We all did.

15:01.196 --> 15:02.017
It was.

15:02.578 --> 15:09.184
But when Matanya turned it into a whooping crane, so I could live to get my straight arrow badge.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.287
Bobby, don't you get it?

15:11.967 --> 15:13.749
Your dad made all that up.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.552
There's no such thing as a snipe.

15:16.932 --> 15:17.213
No!

15:17.793 --> 15:19.655
My dad is the arrow leader.

15:20.096 --> 15:22.438
He speaks only with honor.

15:22.857 --> 15:25.482
We'll ditch the carcass by the interstate in the morning.

15:26.223 --> 15:27.305
Now let's just go to sleep.

15:27.826 --> 15:31.994
Yes, yes, we'll all just go to sleep now.

15:32.575 --> 15:34.339
Bill, get his pants and shoes.

15:34.980 --> 15:35.481
Uncle Doug.

15:39.609 --> 15:39.909
Sir!

15:41.292 --> 15:41.372
Huh?

15:41.504 --> 15:42.805
Uh-huh.

15:42.825 --> 15:43.086
Uh-huh.

15:43.326 --> 15:45.048
Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you.

15:45.508 --> 15:48.952
I'm with the Forestry Service and we're looking for a missing whooping crane.

15:49.653 --> 15:50.534
Uh-huh.

15:50.554 --> 15:50.694
Uh-huh.

15:50.714 --> 15:56.261
And well, you see the birds tagged with the little transmitter and uptracked it to within ten yards of your campsite.

15:56.481 --> 15:57.762
You haven't seen it, have you?

15:57.782 --> 16:02.948
Uh, whooping crane in these parts, I think I would have noticed something like that.

16:03.008 --> 16:05.431
They're pretty rare, aren't they?

16:05.651 --> 16:08.254
Oh yes, very rare and beautiful.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.316
Sir, do you know anything about this?

16:10.717 --> 16:15.422
Yeah, man, I tell you what, didn't even want him to snipe us last night, man, with him sticking and bagging and quack-quack, man.

16:15.482 --> 16:18.925
If he'd go woo-loo, talking about that big mistake, y'all.

16:19.126 --> 16:19.987
Just right there in that cooler.

16:21.428 --> 16:24.932
Well, if you do see anything, you can contact the ranger station.

16:25.432 --> 16:26.493
How about you boys?

16:26.674 --> 16:30.758
Well, yeah, we... Uh, they can't talk for 24 hours.

16:31.479 --> 16:32.780
Order of the straight arrow, you know?

16:33.040 --> 16:33.441
Gotcha.

16:33.881 --> 16:35.423
I was in the order myself.

16:37.732 --> 16:41.430
Ah, the straight arrow hasn't changed a bit since I was a boy.

16:42.524 --> 16:43.866
We gotta get rid of this bird.

16:44.747 --> 16:45.228
What the?

16:45.649 --> 16:47.071
We metanya!

16:47.091 --> 16:48.293
We metanya!

16:48.433 --> 16:49.595
We metanya!

16:49.835 --> 16:50.276
Bobby!

16:50.376 --> 16:50.777
Cripes!

16:50.897 --> 16:52.018
Put that thing down!

16:52.059 --> 16:53.561
Stop fooling around.

16:53.641 --> 16:55.444
We've got to bury that thing fast.

16:55.644 --> 16:57.327
We can't just bury it, Dad.

16:57.347 --> 16:57.847
Remember?

16:58.248 --> 17:01.793
We metanya wants us to honor the bird's sacred spirit.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.018
And we will do just that in the dumpster behind Stuckeys.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.143
Now let's get out of here before someone sees us, okay?

17:10.655 --> 17:11.436
Murderers!

17:12.437 --> 17:13.599
I have got to tell the ranger.

17:23.493 --> 17:23.913
Brock!

17:24.374 --> 17:24.995
Grasha.

17:26.076 --> 17:27.398
I almost could not get away.

17:27.438 --> 17:30.202
Amigo, it is time for some news operas.

17:30.623 --> 17:32.325
Or shoes as you say in your country.

17:32.896 --> 17:35.699
Senora, I have an Italian mock alligator.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.221
You are going to love.

17:37.901 --> 17:40.144
A size 16 for Senora Ibanez.

17:40.664 --> 17:41.205
Cripple-E.

17:42.086 --> 17:43.227
Brock, you are a genius.

17:43.587 --> 17:46.210
Now, this is why I come to Lubbock's very big shoes.

17:46.591 --> 17:49.534
I'll have Chuck and Buzz carry the box out to the car for you.

17:49.954 --> 17:51.896
I saw him waving it over his head, really proud.

17:52.737 --> 17:52.877
Uh-huh.

17:53.078 --> 17:55.500
I also heard that they were hunting snipe last night.

17:55.841 --> 17:56.962
There is no snipe.

17:57.522 --> 17:58.063
My God.

17:58.523 --> 18:01.907
How many more species have to be wiped out before we learn?

18:01.972 --> 18:02.473
Easy.

18:02.914 --> 18:03.194
Easy.

18:03.354 --> 18:04.196
Don't draw attention.

18:04.256 --> 18:05.117
We're almost there.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.059
We're going to make it.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.263
What's that flapping sound?

18:08.663 --> 18:11.668
Taste the wind one last time, bird spirit.

18:11.689 --> 18:12.189
Bobby!

18:18.099 --> 18:19.802
There they are, the nature haters.

18:19.983 --> 18:20.824
Let's get them!

18:33.427 --> 18:35.250
Pull over right here by that culvert.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.241
Well, we can't stuff this bird in here.

18:43.301 --> 18:44.082
It'll never fit.

18:44.663 --> 18:45.464
You could eat it.

18:45.965 --> 18:46.386
Damn.

18:46.646 --> 18:49.150
And I filled up on silent sticks.

18:49.170 --> 18:55.258
Brother Bird, I have given you a last flight and made my peace with you.

18:55.278 --> 18:57.822
I release your spirit to win Mitanya.

18:58.563 --> 18:59.905
Woo-loo-loo!

19:00.486 --> 19:01.948
Woo-loo-loo!

19:02.215 --> 19:04.257
Son, would you please knock it off?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.599
You're driving me nuts.

19:05.619 --> 19:07.201
There is no wema, Tanya.

19:07.761 --> 19:11.486
It's just some damn nonsense we made up to fill out the weekend.

19:11.606 --> 19:12.347
Tell him, Dale.

19:12.787 --> 19:14.990
How do you know my name, Crane Killer?

19:15.710 --> 19:18.333
I never met any of you people before in my life.

19:19.214 --> 19:19.995
Tell him, Bill.

19:20.476 --> 19:21.397
He's right by me.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.398
It's all a crock.

19:23.259 --> 19:27.804
Those spirit bags of yours just makes wife's old socks, and by the way, I want them back.

19:28.685 --> 19:31.969
So, everything you said was all a lie?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.503
Yes, that's the secret of the Snipe Hunt.

19:34.563 --> 19:35.664
That's the whole point.

19:36.866 --> 19:41.952
Oh, I get it.

19:41.972 --> 19:42.132
I guess.

19:42.152 --> 19:44.115
Bobby, I didn't mean to let you down.

19:44.135 --> 19:54.948
I just... When Dale and Bill and Boomhauer and me went through this as kids, all the tricks and lies from our dads, they were part of the experience.

19:54.968 --> 19:58.092
It brought us all together, you know, us against them.

19:58.207 --> 20:00.132
I don't want to be against you.

20:00.473 --> 20:01.395
You're my dad.

20:01.876 --> 20:03.841
We're supposed to be on the same team.

20:04.623 --> 20:06.248
Of course we're on the same team.

20:06.829 --> 20:07.451
You and me.

20:07.471 --> 20:14.629
And now Team Hill is going to bury that whooping crane together and get out of this park without getting caught.

20:18.710 --> 20:26.259
Sir, you lied to me, you lied to this little boy, and I don't know what you did to this gentleman in his underwear.

20:26.919 --> 20:29.563
I'm going to have to take you into the ranger station.

20:30.383 --> 20:32.186
Son, hand me the bird body.

20:32.646 --> 20:40.996
I need it for evidence.

20:41.016 --> 20:42.818
It's a miracle.

20:42.838 --> 20:44.179
Well, I'll be damned.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.422
We metanya.

20:47.937 --> 20:50.941
I guess knocking a crane unconscious isn't a crime.

20:51.382 --> 20:52.884
Although it's probably not good for them.

20:52.944 --> 20:54.586
You're free to go.

20:54.606 --> 21:06.123
I knew you wouldn't lie to me, Dad.

21:06.763 --> 21:08.606
That was just the final test.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.430
When Matanya does exist.

21:11.647 --> 21:14.192
The bird was just unconscious, Bobby.

21:14.653 --> 21:19.061
No, it was dead until I made Wilma Tanya bring it back to life.

21:20.063 --> 21:21.546
I'm a shaman.

21:21.566 --> 21:23.229
Oh, God, my head hurts.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.133
I can heal you, Dad.

21:26.235 --> 21:27.217
Woo-loo-loo!

21:27.918 --> 21:30.904
Woo-loo-loo!

21:51.472 --> 21:52.574
Well, welcome home boys.

21:52.614 --> 21:53.256
Did you have fun?

21:54.458 --> 21:55.200
Don't ask.

21:55.961 --> 21:57.184
How was your weekend?

21:58.086 --> 21:59.388
Oh, same old, same old.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.392
Did you do some shopping?

22:02.375 --> 22:04.018
Yeah, I bought a microwave.

22:04.579 --> 22:09.990
Boy, I tell you what, this family goes through microwaves quicker than most people go through shoes.

22:11.153 --> 22:12.315
Yeah.
