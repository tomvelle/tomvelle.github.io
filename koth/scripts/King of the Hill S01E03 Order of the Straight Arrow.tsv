2444	8093	Hey, me and Dale are taking Bobby's troop up by the lake for order of the straight arrow this weekend.
8133	10436	Y'all want to come for old time's sake?
10456	11538	Well, of course I'll go.
11558	14863	I'll never miss an order of the straight arrow.
15745	16706	Not since ours.
17107	19430	Yeah, ours was something special.
20492	21754	Now for the final test.
22355	23296	The snipe hunt.
23677	24598	Not gonna sugarcoat it.
24999	27523	Some of you ain't coming back.
27858	32064	Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era.
32084	33986	Those who don't, will be dead.
35248	36530	Question.
36550	37110	Are you ready?
37371	38492	Yeah!
41597	45161	If you want the test of silence, useless, give me a silent stick.
48105	51430	For the rest of your long, miserable life, you will carry the scar of failure.
51850	53072	Now go give me a beer.
55533	59240	And you boys get out there and bag some snipe!
63228	63769	Snipe!
63989	64771	Shut up, Dale.
64991	65913	There is no snipe.
65953	67496	I heard my dad talking to your dad.
67757	68959	So what are we doing out here?
69440	71384	We're going to get snackered, I tell you what, boy, man.
71424	77355	I want to get all messed up and just pollute our minds out of three sheets of dang old wind, man.
80491	87763	I grew up I'm gonna drink this stuff every day just like my dad and fly jets and maybe even be an astronaut.
87984	91550	I'm gonna live in London and be a rich millionaire and have people killed.
93092	97660	I'm gonna sell propane and propane accessories if my grades are good enough.
100945	102788	Oh kids and their crazy dreams.
104652	106735	I'm so depressed I can't even blink.
138035	142701	Well, we're gonna make some men out of those twelve-year-old boys tomorrow, I tell you what.
143002	145224	Well, we still get to play practical jokes, right?
145685	147007	They're not jokes, Bill.
147287	148529	They're painful lessons.
148969	151713	I thank my father for all the tricks he played on me.
152234	155037	He taught me the most wonderful lesson a child can learn.
155718	157080	Never trust nobody.
158682	161646	That's how I know Bob Dole's faking that dead arm.
161761	165746	I tell you what you do, man, I don't even know how to handle a water trick that's gonna work every time, man.
165766	172514	You just put it in a water like that, and it don't, it's, they spend a whole dadgum day like that cleaning up that dang old pee-pee.
172534	174376	Yeah, but those are getting tired.
174756	176078	We need some new material.
176578	179522	Dad, can me and Bobby bring a life preservers?
179962	183246	If you want to be sissies... He said yes!
183648	187095	Hey, Dale, uh, there's your wife's, uh... Healer.
187435	190802	Yeah, John Redcorn, let's get some funny Indian stuff to do.
191143	192626	Hey, John Redcorn!
193087	195631	Hank, Dale, Bill, Whomhower.
196072	202645	John Redcorn, we've got this order of the straight arrow retreat tomorrow, and I was wondering... I'd be honored to look after your wife.
205932	206112	Oh!
206581	208445	Well, gee, thanks.
208465	214039	But what I was really wondering is if you had some good Indian stuff for the ceremony around the campfire.
214921	219291	Hmm, our rituals are considered sacred and are passed down only in the nation.
219311	220674	Oh well, that don't bother us.
220895	223020	Hell no, we'll take a sacred one.
223000	226088	There is a very ancient ceremony I learned from my grandfather.
226710	231563	We call upon the sacred Wimatenya, and we ask him to breathe life into our spirit bag.
231964	236716	See, spirit bags, Wimatenya, funny looking headband.
237278	239203	Oh, the boys are going to eat this stuff up.
239960	241942	The spirit bag is very sacred.
242343	243484	You should not make light.
245447	247269	I like how you say everything's sacred.
247329	248250	That's funny too.
248751	249752	Let's do that, Hank.
250192	253056	I got a bunch of ladies tennis socks we can use for spirit bags.
254037	255058	I got them in a divorce.
255699	257741	Now, every time she plays, she gets blisters.
258662	260264	It's been six years, Bill.
260304	263368	Don't you think she'd have bought some new socks by now?
263770	266436	I want to get that straight arrow patch so bad.
266476	270565	I'm going to put it right here next to my sewing patch.
270966	272709	It's supposed to be hard.
273291	277560	I heard they make you walk on hot coals and then you have to eat them.
278462	278522	Ew!
279083	280446	After you walk on them?
281928	284932	Hell, that's hot!
284952	286655	Hell, you're not kidding!
286975	287496	Fuck!
287516	288217	Hardone, mate!
288257	290040	Did I just hear what I almost heard?
290060	293985	I was gonna say... Fuuuugget about it!
294506	297571	Son, Peggy Hill knows half a swear word when she hears one.
298011	298752	Can I go to sleep?
300194	301717	You had the coolest mom.
302458	304360	She smells like Miracle Whip.
306123	306644	Hey, guys.
307245	308106	Hey, Eustace.
308126	309047	Hey, Eustace.
311371	311631	Hey, Eustace.
312556	313237	All right, Randy.
313878	316041	Remember, the purpose of this weekend is to have fun.
316882	319987	Daddy loves you whether you get your straight arrow patch or not.
321088	321769	What a load.
322210	326135	Can you imagine how I'd have turned out if my dad had loved me no matter what?
326155	327778	Thanks for the bus fare, Aunt Peggy.
328058	328819	Don't be silly, honey.
328839	330722	It is very important that you be there for your mama.
331183	331984	This is her big day.
332224	335429	Well, actually, her big day is a sentencing.
335489	336711	This is just the arrangement.
337191	337992	Here's a fun saver.
338052	339154	Take lots of pictures.
345057	346138	There we go.
346158	346899	Have a good time.
347219	348080	Here's a fun saver.
348220	349181	Take lots of pictures.
349521	353605	Gosh, Pig, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were anxious to see us go.
354206	356428	Well, that is not true.
356908	358490	You and Bobby are my whole life.
358890	359811	Come on, kids!
359831	360332	Let's go!
360832	361913	Everybody in the car!
361933	362794	I'm the light now!
363074	363975	Hold on, boys.
364516	372263	Before we go, we have to ask the Great Spirit, uh, Wumatanya, to watch over us on this trip.
372428	379377	This trip is about the sacredness of Mother Earth and all she gives us.
380058	383141	So pee now, because once we're on the road, we ain't stopping.
385284	386546	I'll see you Sunday, pig.
386606	387246	Okay.
387287	387667	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
387687	387927	All right.
387967	390370	Bye-bye.
390390	392072	Oh, damn it.
392092	394095	Looks like we're delayed a couple hours.
394916	397339	I gotta charge up the battery.
398939	417457	Drop the clutch on!
417477	418318	We metanye!
418779	420660	Let's spot license plates.
420680	421922	I see Texas, we metanye!
422062	423924	We metanye, there's another Texas, we metanye!
423964	427427	We metanye, I see Texas, we metanye!
427981	430766	Wimitanyay, Texas, Wimitanyay.
431227	433591	What you guys just shut up?
433611	435374	You didn't say Wimitanyay!
436777	437859	Boom, Howard, pass them.
437879	438640	I got an idea.
438800	439281	Pass them up.
439301	441185	Wimitanyay, ask Mr. Gribble's butt, Wimitanyay.
441205	451423	Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in,
452838	454860	I see Texas, we matane!
454880	456021	All right, that's it.
456662	458203	Everybody pile out right now.
459925	463329	Okay, the 24-hour oath of silence starts now.
463989	465631	Hear your silence sticks.
465651	466732	Those are slim jeans.
467132	468934	That's what the white man calls them.
469575	473739	When matanya calls them silent sticks to test your spirit of shutting up.
474500	476382	Each time you talk, I take a bite.
477022	478644	Talk five times and you're out.
478664	481647	24-hour silence starting now.
487685	488346	Right now?
488946	490708	Bobby, son, you just talked.
491248	493351	Now, I'll let that pass, but don't talk again.
493391	495753	Thanks, Dad.
497094	499216	Son, give me that slim, Jim.
512529	514351	I'm hungry.
514371	515312	No problem.
521165	521425	Ha!
522026	522808	That was a test.
523388	526453	Joseph, give Mr. Dothrieve a bite of your silent stick.
527094	529738	Remember kids, you never know when you're going to be tested.
531441	532582	Now who else is hungry?
532923	533564	I am!
533584	533985	Gotcha!
534566	538171	Bobby, Randy, Garth, pass your silent sticks up.
539133	541076	See kids, it's harder than you think.
541937	544140	You don't want to end up like Randy's dad.
544461	546684	My dad's a successful patent lawyer.
547065	549248	Not in the eyes of Wumitanya.
551270	552231	I'm still hungry.
553253	554795	Who wants a dollar, say me?
554815	555176	Me!
558681	560043	Well, these things are addictive.
560824	562586	Lord Bobby, watch out, son.
563027	564950	You've lost more chores than anybody.
565430	570958	Now don't talk, no matter what.
570978	572741	But, Matanya, Mr. Gripple's not wearing his seat belt.
572801	575304	Bobby, you just got four in a row.
575425	577868	One more bite and you can't make straight arrow.
579805	581227	I'll take that jerky now.
584511	586674	Here it is, boys, the great outdoors.
592662	599551	Thanks to our efforts, we have preserved the nesting areas for the Texas spotted owl, the snail darter, and the endangered whooping crane.
600091	603636	And we eliminated 300 logging jobs.
606923	611591	Also, this note people, the brown herbal ecstasy is bad.
611611	615537	Do not, I repeat, do not take the brown herbal ecstasy.
615797	616538	Thank you all.
617200	620986	Oh man, what kind of lefty hootenanny is this?
621687	625313	Look at that one bouncing around in front of God and everybody.
626054	628678	Would it kill a tree if she wore a bra?
640505	651400	I'm beginning to think this silence thing is just so we don't bother them.
651581	654024	They're not testing anything except for how dumb we are.
654665	655506	It's a whole trick.
655726	657048	My dad wouldn't trick us!
661154	663097	My dad wouldn't trick us.
667203	668925	We want to donate!
672753	675637	Wematanye, who wants another beer, Wematanye?
680884	682446	I am kicking elk.
682466	686832	As long as the sacred fire is burning, the oath of silence is suspended.
688475	689396	Take the log.
689416	690998	Shut up, I'm talking here.
691805	707722	We of the Order of the Straight Arrow, call upon the spirit Wematane, protector of the sacred ground, that brings us cool water to drink, and energy efficient, clean, burning, propane gas for all our sacred heating and cooking needs.
708223	710585	Wematane says, respect the earth.
711186	713589	She's ours by God, our tax is paid for.
713649	717753	Also, it says here, you gotta love all her creatures.
718674	719755	Uh, let's see.
720456	721457	Oh, here we go.
721859	730469	Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you're going to recommend us to the spirit in the sky, with liberty and justice for all.
731150	734234	Womitanya is with you, and with Texas.
734855	735275	Amen.
735856	740822	Amen.
740842	741843	I'd like a room, please.
743606	747310	I am Senora Groscha, Ibanez, and I will be paying in cash.
748302	751747	Now we will say the oath of the order of the straight arrow.
752368	754752	A straight arrow tells the truth.
755974	757997	A straight arrow loves nature.
758638	767031	A straight arrow is against Bill H.R.B.D.7 to allow the importation of South American propane.
767452	768814	We must turn it.
769355	772740	And now for the final test, the snipe hunt.
773193	777701	You are about to come face to face with the deadliest beast in creation.
778382	785274	Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era, and those who don't will be dead.
785314	789842	Oh, Wematanie, protect us on our hunt.
790643	795972	All right, this here's your whoop-ass stick to beat the snipe back in case he comes at you.
795992	797715	Well, what does a snipe look like?
797780	805112	It's got red glowing eyes, long crooked teeth, a claw and a tail with another claw in the end.
806594	807175	Easy, Dale.
807917	809239	Bill and I'll take the lead.
809299	811202	Boom, Hauer and Dale will bring up the rear.
811803	813946	Remember, the snap call is this.
814627	817152	Woo-loo-loo, woo-loo-loo.
818514	819656	Well, call him out, boys.
819696	821138	He's not just gonna show up.
824594	848188	got here look out Billy almost got you they'll be out there another hour then we'll go get them boy this takes me back what are you talking about
851797	854628	Oh my lord, that's a whooping crane.
854668	858021	There's only five of those left in the world.
858081	859868	Well, four now.
860330	862920	Then we should be thankful we got the opportunity to see one.
868182	869344	Now you done it.
869804	872067	Now you really gone and done it.
872227	873189	What do you mean, you?
873269	874611	We're all in this together.
874851	875692	Whoa, no.
876093	880398	Me and Boomhauer came on our own trip in our own conveyance.
880418	883803	You and I may be acquainted, but we are not traveling companions.
884524	888068	I'm merely here to enjoy Earth Day and play some hacky sack.
888609	891473	Dale, I'm gonna need you to give me the keys now.
895030	896131	I can't believe it.
896171	898033	It wasn't your fault, Bobby.
898534	899635	You thought it was a snipe.
900055	900836	We all did.
901196	902017	It was.
902578	909184	But when Matanya turned it into a whooping crane, so I could live to get my straight arrow badge.
909625	911287	Bobby, don't you get it?
911967	913749	Your dad made all that up.
914710	916552	There's no such thing as a snipe.
916932	917213	No!
917793	919655	My dad is the arrow leader.
920096	922438	He speaks only with honor.
922857	925482	We'll ditch the carcass by the interstate in the morning.
926223	927305	Now let's just go to sleep.
927826	931994	Yes, yes, we'll all just go to sleep now.
932575	934339	Bill, get his pants and shoes.
934980	935481	Uncle Doug.
939609	939909	Sir!
941292	941372	Huh?
941504	942805	Uh-huh.
942825	943086	Uh-huh.
943326	945048	Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you.
945508	948952	I'm with the Forestry Service and we're looking for a missing whooping crane.
949653	950534	Uh-huh.
950554	950694	Uh-huh.
950714	956261	And well, you see the birds tagged with the little transmitter and uptracked it to within ten yards of your campsite.
956481	957762	You haven't seen it, have you?
957782	962948	Uh, whooping crane in these parts, I think I would have noticed something like that.
963008	965431	They're pretty rare, aren't they?
965651	968254	Oh yes, very rare and beautiful.
968234	970316	Sir, do you know anything about this?
970717	975422	Yeah, man, I tell you what, didn't even want him to snipe us last night, man, with him sticking and bagging and quack-quack, man.
975482	978925	If he'd go woo-loo, talking about that big mistake, y'all.
979126	979987	Just right there in that cooler.
981428	984932	Well, if you do see anything, you can contact the ranger station.
985432	986493	How about you boys?
986674	990758	Well, yeah, we... Uh, they can't talk for 24 hours.
991479	992780	Order of the straight arrow, you know?
993040	993441	Gotcha.
993881	995423	I was in the order myself.
997732	1001430	Ah, the straight arrow hasn't changed a bit since I was a boy.
1002524	1003866	We gotta get rid of this bird.
1004747	1005228	What the?
1005649	1007071	We metanya!
1007091	1008293	We metanya!
1008433	1009595	We metanya!
1009835	1010276	Bobby!
1010376	1010777	Cripes!
1010897	1012018	Put that thing down!
1012059	1013561	Stop fooling around.
1013641	1015444	We've got to bury that thing fast.
1015644	1017327	We can't just bury it, Dad.
1017347	1017847	Remember?
1018248	1021793	We metanya wants us to honor the bird's sacred spirit.
1021813	1025018	And we will do just that in the dumpster behind Stuckeys.
1025399	1028143	Now let's get out of here before someone sees us, okay?
1030655	1031436	Murderers!
1032437	1033599	I have got to tell the ranger.
1043493	1043913	Brock!
1044374	1044995	Grasha.
1046076	1047398	I almost could not get away.
1047438	1050202	Amigo, it is time for some news operas.
1050623	1052325	Or shoes as you say in your country.
1052896	1055699	Senora, I have an Italian mock alligator.
1055999	1057221	You are going to love.
1057901	1060144	A size 16 for Senora Ibanez.
1060664	1061205	Cripple-E.
1062086	1063227	Brock, you are a genius.
1063587	1066210	Now, this is why I come to Lubbock's very big shoes.
1066591	1069534	I'll have Chuck and Buzz carry the box out to the car for you.
1069954	1071896	I saw him waving it over his head, really proud.
1072737	1072877	Uh-huh.
1073078	1075500	I also heard that they were hunting snipe last night.
1075841	1076962	There is no snipe.
1077522	1078063	My God.
1078523	1081907	How many more species have to be wiped out before we learn?
1081972	1082473	Easy.
1082914	1083194	Easy.
1083354	1084196	Don't draw attention.
1084256	1085117	We're almost there.
1085418	1086059	We're going to make it.
1086800	1088263	What's that flapping sound?
1088663	1091668	Taste the wind one last time, bird spirit.
1091689	1092189	Bobby!
1098099	1099802	There they are, the nature haters.
1099983	1100824	Let's get them!
1113427	1115250	Pull over right here by that culvert.
1121378	1123241	Well, we can't stuff this bird in here.
1123301	1124082	It'll never fit.
1124663	1125464	You could eat it.
1125965	1126386	Damn.
1126646	1129150	And I filled up on silent sticks.
1129170	1135258	Brother Bird, I have given you a last flight and made my peace with you.
1135278	1137822	I release your spirit to win Mitanya.
1138563	1139905	Woo-loo-loo!
1140486	1141948	Woo-loo-loo!
1142215	1144257	Son, would you please knock it off?
1144277	1145599	You're driving me nuts.
1145619	1147201	There is no wema, Tanya.
1147761	1151486	It's just some damn nonsense we made up to fill out the weekend.
1151606	1152347	Tell him, Dale.
1152787	1154990	How do you know my name, Crane Killer?
1155710	1158333	I never met any of you people before in my life.
1159214	1159995	Tell him, Bill.
1160476	1161397	He's right by me.
1161417	1162398	It's all a crock.
1163259	1167804	Those spirit bags of yours just makes wife's old socks, and by the way, I want them back.
1168685	1171969	So, everything you said was all a lie?
1172000	1174503	Yes, that's the secret of the Snipe Hunt.
1174563	1175664	That's the whole point.
1176866	1181952	Oh, I get it.
1181972	1182132	I guess.
1182152	1184115	Bobby, I didn't mean to let you down.
1184135	1194948	I just... When Dale and Bill and Boomhauer and me went through this as kids, all the tricks and lies from our dads, they were part of the experience.
1194968	1198092	It brought us all together, you know, us against them.
1198207	1200132	I don't want to be against you.
1200473	1201395	You're my dad.
1201876	1203841	We're supposed to be on the same team.
1204623	1206248	Of course we're on the same team.
1206829	1207451	You and me.
1207471	1214629	And now Team Hill is going to bury that whooping crane together and get out of this park without getting caught.
1218710	1226259	Sir, you lied to me, you lied to this little boy, and I don't know what you did to this gentleman in his underwear.
1226919	1229563	I'm going to have to take you into the ranger station.
1230383	1232186	Son, hand me the bird body.
1232646	1240996	I need it for evidence.
1241016	1242818	It's a miracle.
1242838	1244179	Well, I'll be damned.
1244760	1246422	We metanya.
1247937	1250941	I guess knocking a crane unconscious isn't a crime.
1251382	1252884	Although it's probably not good for them.
1252944	1254586	You're free to go.
1254606	1266123	I knew you wouldn't lie to me, Dad.
1266763	1268606	That was just the final test.
1269227	1271430	When Matanya does exist.
1271647	1274192	The bird was just unconscious, Bobby.
1274653	1279061	No, it was dead until I made Wilma Tanya bring it back to life.
1280063	1281546	I'm a shaman.
1281566	1283229	Oh, God, my head hurts.
1283891	1285133	I can heal you, Dad.
1286235	1287217	Woo-loo-loo!
1287918	1290904	Woo-loo-loo!
1311472	1312574	Well, welcome home boys.
1312614	1313256	Did you have fun?
1314458	1315200	Don't ask.
1315961	1317184	How was your weekend?
1318086	1319388	Oh, same old, same old.
1320030	1321392	Did you do some shopping?
1322375	1324018	Yeah, I bought a microwave.
1324579	1329990	Boy, I tell you what, this family goes through microwaves quicker than most people go through shoes.
1331153	1332315	Yeah.
