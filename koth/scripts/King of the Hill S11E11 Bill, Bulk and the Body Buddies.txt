It's important to me to make everyone look good, but I never forget that my main job is to make everyone's head fit in the helmet.
Hey, Norman.
What you got there?
Notice for our army of physical examinations.
Barbers are up in six weeks.
I have to get another physical?
But didn't I just get one?
Uh... Four years ago.
You counting on another miracle?
This... this thing...
You making me run?
Well, soldier, looks like you passed.
Oh, this isn't right.
Frank, your bonehead, you forgot to reset.
Well, what do we do?
Congratulations, soldier.
You passed.
Now I got lucky once.
Maybe it'll happen again.
You really need luck?
Okay, you can rub my head.
Bill, you've got six weeks to pass that physical.
That's plenty of time to get into shape.
Really?
Yeah, man, but you don't talk to me like an old physician before about doing an exercise program.
I mean, I'm talking about an old thing.
Boom, man.
Yes, you need to start eating right, but what you really need is exercise.
Hmm?
Have you considered joining a gym?
A gym?
I can't work out in public in front of all those healthy people.
I'm too fat.
You're too fat to go to a gym?
Poor Bill.
Too fat to work out, not fat enough to live in bed.
Well, you can always work out at home.
A ton of people have tried that and are now selling their equipment on our community bulletin board.
Hey, that's Principal Moss's address.
This is some nice equipment, Carl.
Wait, property of Tom Landry Middle School.
The football team got all new equipment.
I thought, as principal, it was my duty to sell it for the children.
So, Bill, what do you think?
I don't know.
I mean, I don't want to lose my job.
That's where I go every day.
But this is also pricey.
The children will take less.
Well, how about we all go in on it together?
Then everyone can use it.
We'll set it up in your garage.
It'll be like our own neighborhood gym.
So you guys will get me in shape?
No, Bill.
We'll be there to help you get started, but the simple fact is only you can get you into shape.
Yeah, while I'm at it, why don't I fly to the moon and marry a mermaid?
You can do this, Bill.
You used to be a high school athlete.
All you need is focus, a little hard work, and self-discipline.
I can throw in an overhead projector.
This is the perfect place for a gym.
It's close, it's quiet, and it already spilled.
Yeah, it's so much better than my gym.
Do you know how many skivvy old men's cell phone cameras go off when I get on that in the thigh machine?
I'm kinda tired of my gym.
The machines are great, but it's nothing but gay sex all the time.
This should come with a cape!
Come on, Bill, you're up.
Maybe I could lift weights later, when everyone is gone.
This is not the place for you to finally start feeling embarrassed.
Yeah, it's a safe environment, should.
Peggy tutored on the hack squat machine and nobody said a word.
I did it!
Lou, man.
I can get in shape.
I can pass my physical.
I can fly to the moon and marry a mermaid.
To the moon!
Pet nectar.
Insane fuel for hardcore masks and road map vascularity.
Hmm.
Ah!
Oh!
Sorry.
I thought you were a bear.
You looking to get jacked, brother?
I'm here to get some vitamins.
Vitamins?
You looking to fight the sniffles or match your pump?
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.
Right on, bro.
Have you ever seen anything more healthy than this?
I can't be that healthy.
You can't hit your way into that body, Andre.
Lucky for you, I can help.
Well, I would definitely love to help, but Hank says I have to do this myself.
Hank?
I hate to see a guy like you, with real desire, being led astray by a workout zero, like this chump, Hank!
Can you hang to this?
Well, heck, I'd even have those.
Exactly.
You know how I got them.
Finish?
From a well-crafted total fitness regiment.
Tell me, brother, where do you work out?
I just have a little gym at home.
Friend, this is your lucky day.
The Dirkster has taken over your training.
No, I could never report you.
I mean, you're huge.
I am.
That's why the local gyms won't let me train.
They're jealous of my pump.
So this is what we're gonna do.
I'll train you for free, and you let me use your home gym.
So it's not all up to me?
Would that sound great?
It's beyond great.
I can get you stacked, jacked, and juiced, but I need 100% commitment.
I need you to pledge allegiance to the nation of pump.
I need you to vow to get in the best shape of your life.
You in, brother?
Brother!
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Dirk says this rapid-release protein supplement will really max my pump.
Question.
Who is Dirk?
What is a rapid-release protein supplement?
Where is your pump?
And why does Dirk want to max it?
But Dirk is a personal trainer.
He's gonna create a workout system for me to ensure total fitness.
What?
Well, that's what professional personal trainers do.
They don't just send you out on your own and hope for the best.
You know, like you did, Hank.
Damn it, Hank.
Sooner or later, your sunny optimism is going to get us all killed.
Ah, so nice!
Who thought Bill's house could function as something other than a shrine to crushing misery?
No!
My trainer's here!
Hey Bill, this is Gorilla and Coach.
Let's blast some delts!
You're really in the house.
Whoa, great.
Tea party's over.
Excuse me, what are you doing?
Don't worry.
Just adding a little resistance to shred your buys.
Hey there, sweets.
Let me help you.
See, your elbows aren't tight, so you're missing out on a sick rep.
His arms having a heart attack!
I'll tell you why I don't lift weights.
Because every time I start to lift, I wait.
Quiet down, Bobby.
Sorry, Dirk, you were talking about my delts.
Big up, gorilla!
Represent!
Hey, Hank!
Bill, these are your trainers?
They're huge.
I know!
You can tell them that if you want to.
It's not rude.
That's okay.
So, those pants sure are, uh, tiny.
You want to put on some, uh, more pants and come on out for some light cardio?
Cardio?
Sorry, Hank.
No time.
I'm moving on to biceps.
Yeah!
Time to feed the pythons!
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I don't like being around those scary weight-lifter guys.
They talk and yelling.
Yeah, and they look like they're filled with bowling balls.
They are freaks, Hank.
I swear, I saw a live chicken go in that gym that did not come out.
Look, I'm not gonna tell you I enjoyed what I saw, but the truth is they've got Bill working out, and that's what's important.
We'll just have to work around him.
Hey!
Problem?
No, sir!
You know the military physical is mostly running on a treadmill, right?
Run!
These guns run from nothing!
Your bulk is so fierce!
Almost as small as mine!
Damn, it's too bad nobody else is here to see this sweet rip.
Dude, I'm right here and I think you're looking yoked.
I know, but I'm talking about small people.
Huh, we need to make some rules.
Hey Bill, you got a second?
Bill?
What's on your mind?
The thing is, the atmosphere is changed around here and people aren't really comfortable using the gym anymore.
There's nothing comfortable about getting shredded, Hank.
What you're not comfortable with is hard work and pain.
It's because all your people are lazy.
Now, hold on.
Prove me wrong, little man.
Why don't you hit the bench?
I'm not getting on the goddamn bench, Bill.
Quit being a jackass.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you smurfs start your own gym across the way?
Please look about your size.
You're a jerk, Bill.
Just forget it.
You can keep your weights.
Don't take it, personal.
He's just jealous of your juicy rib.
They're just weak.
They want this body, want this power, want this pump!
I'll show them who's a jerk.
All right diesel you need a spot and I need a doctor I pushed it
This is great.
You've reached the threshold.
It's the moment when your entire body is screaming at you to stop and you think there's a realistic chance you might die.
I know it's a good workout when blood vessels in the back of my eyeballs pop.
No agony, no bragging-y.
Am I right?
Diesel's lost focus.
Guys, we're gonna have to move in here and keep him true.
But don't worry, I won't let that happen.
PUSH!
PUSH!
PUSH!
You look like you need a protein fix.
Look at me eating eggs.
Show off.
All right, good stacking, rat guys.
Wait, please.
Can I get a hand?
Nope.
But if you can get up by yourself, you can sleep in your own bed and use your own toilet.
We'll leave the trash metal on for motivation.
George Washington, no mess.
Thomas Jefferson, no mess.
Freakin' Ben Franklin, no mess.
That's why they won't let Arnold be president.
They're jealous.
It ain't right.
War!
Yeah!
Three!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Here comes Jack!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hello?
It's three in the morning.
Bill?
It's me!
It's me, Bill!
Did you just call to let me know you're working out?
Well, okay, I get it.
How much longer till bedtime?
Fourteen minutes.
Righteous.
Alright, Diesel, work on the abs.
But today's a peck day.
Hank, today is Bill's army physical.
Bobby, it's chicken and dumplings for school lunch, and I have a pap smear.
I hate chicken and dumplings.
I'll trade you, Mom.
Dang it.
I bet Bill forgot his physical was today.
You gonna remind him, Dad?
No, I'm not, Bobby.
Mr. Dothrieve is no longer a friend.
He's just a pumped-up, annoying neighbor.
I'm a little grossed out by him, too, Dad, but he was human once.
Well, I guess I should remind him.
If he loses his job, he'll have to sell his weights and then he'll come over here and crush our appliances for exercise.
Can't do it!
Dammit, Diesel.
We haven't gotten a good rep out of you in two days.
We were soft on him.
We let him down.
Bill, did you forget you have your physical today?
Bill hasn't passed our physical yet, and that's the only one that matters, right, Diesel?
Are you okay, Bill?
Sure he's okay.
He's in the zone!
So I tell me, I trade this six pack for this six pack.
She threw me out.
Guys, and Con?
Hello.
I'm worried about Bill.
You should be.
You probably fall somewhere between a drumstick and a ham sandwich to him these days.
He's hurt bad and I think those meatheads are holding him captive.
I know, Boomhauer, but what I just saw was a glimpse of, well, Bill.
I mean, the real Bill, with all his fear and anguish and self-loathing, and he looked hurt.
We need to get him to a doctor.
Push!
Push!
Lock and roll!
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt.
Here's the thing.
We all admire your pump so much, we want you to help swell our thick and such.
Right on, brothers.
I knew you'd come around.
Let's work on those traps.
Actually, maybe he should help with my traps.
His are way bigger than yours.
Yeah, man.
I'll tell you what, man.
Coach, please.
His traps are like speed bumps.
I've got a bus parked on either side of my neck.
Feed bumps.
Check it.
Actually, this one have best physique of all you guys.
Ooh, yeah!
Dig it!
We're gonna get you out of here, Bill.
Okay, let's lift him up.
Man, maybe we do need to lift them down weights, man, and pump her thick, man.
So, what's the situation, doctor?
Is it gonna be okay?
Well, it's incredible.
It's unlike anything I've ever seen.
What are we looking at here?
I don't quite know how to put this.
I mean, we don't even have a term for it, but your rectum ruptured and, well, your internal systems became... ...external.
Oh my god.
I know, it's amazing!
The pain must have been unbearable!
Sorry.
I can't work out for six months.
My muscles will be gone by then.
Well, you looked better without them.
And hey, at least your physical was postponed until you recover.
Yeah.
Well, look at it this way.
You've got a new goal, dropping that extra weight.
Let's start with a really killer walk to the mailbox.
How's that?
You feel the burn?
No.
Perfect.
