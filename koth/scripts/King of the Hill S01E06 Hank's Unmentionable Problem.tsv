37628	39110	How was beauty school, Luanne?
39891	41953	Oh, how did the big shampooing final go?
41993	50383	Well, I passed the lather, but I failed rinse, and then I failed repeat, too, because it includes rinse, which I don't think is very fair.
50423	57031	Um, Hank, you forgot to flush.
57471	58132	Didn't have to.
58452	59293	Didn't do anything.
60355	60455	Oh.
62497	63298	I see.
63869	65352	How long has this been going on?
65633	67857	There's nothing going on, Peg.
68578	69480	That's the problem.
70001	71524	Well, how long have you had this problem?
71685	73508	There is no problem, please.
73669	75873	This is not something we need to talk about.
76735	80322	Well, if you do have a problem, I could... Peggy, please, for God's sakes.
81304	82045	I'm getting a bite.
82687	84831	Is there any chicken fried steak left?
94953	99860	Here.
100421	101022	What's this?
101302	102263	It's megamucil.
102544	106429	I take 10 heaping teaspoons in a glass of water every night to stay regular like that.
106449	107491	I don't want to know that.
107731	108752	Oh, come on, honey.
108792	111136	Look, it is gentle and all-natural.
111196	112137	No, no, no.
112237	113179	Stop, please.
113699	116964	This is my own private, personal, private business.
117144	118145	At least drink the water.
118446	121991	If you drink enough water, it'll flush out your sister's teeth, please.
122011	124234	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
125041	126363	Hey, ancient sausage.
126403	127105	That looks good.
127726	128807	Peggy, where's my breakfast?
132354	133015	What are these?
133876	135439	I baked muffins.
135860	136861	So good for you.
136901	138023	Where's my sausage?
138444	140548	Well, we're out of sausage.
140988	141770	Hey, try a muffin.
141790	142791	They are oat brand.
143493	144855	Uh, sure.
148750	150132	You should eat those, Dad.
150512	152074	They help you make.
152094	152875	Excuse me?
152895	152975	Huh?
154137	155298	What are you implying?
155618	157521	Well, I thought you were constant.
157541	159163	Where would you get such an idea?
159223	160044	That's ridiculous.
160504	163548	Anyway, that's not something you should ever know about your father.
163868	165590	Well, it's pretty obvious.
165651	167813	You were in the bathroom for an hour last night.
167913	168714	No, I wasn't.
169435	170436	Okay, Dad.
171297	171778	Give me that.
176344	177525	What is it, Lady Bird?
178653	180335	You wanna go out again?
180375	189184	Show off.
189204	191106	Oh Nancy, I'm worried about Hank.
191546	195150	He hasn't done his business in four days.
196131	199114	Good lord, poor Hank.
199134	200235	He looks so healthy.
201516	203358	But then, you know, so did Elvis Presley.
203559	204019	Nancy.
204472	206296	You don't think it's something serious?
206517	209884	Well, I'm a meteorologist, not a doctor.
210265	214495	But if I had to make an educated guess, I'd say he's got polio.
215978	216740	Oh, all right.
216800	218083	I'm not a meteorologist.
218163	219105	I'm a weather girl.
219676	222824	So Hank, what's this I hear about you being backed up?
223245	223626	Nothing.
223727	224148	What?
224569	226694	Who are you thinking about talking to?
226755	227456	It's not me.
227617	228359	I'm fine.
228619	230063	Well, that's not what I heard.
230384	231326	Heard from who?
231487	231888	Dale.
232329	233472	How does Dale know?
233673	234234	Nancy.
234515	236520	Nancy knows too?
236585	237386	Who?
237406	238147	That Peggy.
238747	242151	Why not just take the door off the bathroom and put it out on the lawn?
242391	245314	Oh Hank, it happens to everyone now and then.
245374	247797	There's no reason to be embarrassed.
247977	250580	Maybe I'm not the one who should be embarrassed.
250620	251701	Did you ever think of that?
252262	254124	Maybe you're going a little too much.
254885	258468	Once every four or five days gives me more free time.
259089	262693	You want to spend all your time on the toilet, be my guest.
262673	264115	Have you tried squatting?
264516	266459	It takes pressure off the lower body.
267020	271127	You know, Hank, I find a ride on the lawnmower helps.
271147	273691	Would you please stop talking about this?
274612	274893	Hey, Hank.
275393	279360	You know, I've been thinking about y'all and y'all dang old bottom and all what's gonna get moving again.
279400	281663	I think y'all ought to go jogging and swim in the water buns, man.
281683	283967	They're gonna be bad having you pooping just like you used to, man.
284027	285429	I know it's gonna work.
285449	287372	It helped my aunt after her pregnancy.
287893	289235	I don't know you, do I?
289576	290217	No, you don't.
290804	293007	Would you all please leave me be?
293087	295330	This is no one's business but my own.
300436	303861	Okay, but I've got one that's guaranteed to work for you Hank.
304421	307205	You take a spoonful of bacon grease.
307345	308947	I'm not eating bacon grease.
309428	311310	You didn't let me finish.
312202	316746	Simple chronic constipation can be a symptom of a more serious condition.
317347	317927	I should know.
318528	321110	I'm former Surgeon General C. Everett Coop.
321130	325435	Why did you have to go tell Nancy about my bathroom shortcomings?
325455	330339	Food that is not absorbed becomes waste and enters the pouch like sea cum.
330559	332962	Who the hell is that, Howard Stern?
334183	338547	Temperature is a pleasant 70 degrees and on a more personal note,
339050	343857	I want to wish my friend Hank Hill a quick recovery for his embarrassing constipation.
344318	346602	Oh, Peggy, why'd you do this to me?
346662	347844	Now everybody knows.
348144	350027	Oh, Hank, I was worried.
350267	351870	So worried to yourself?
351990	353653	Well, I'm tired of worrying to myself.
354093	355896	It's better to talk things out, Hank.
355916	358760	Not these things, not toilet things.
359121	359782	All right, Hank.
360443	365070	All right, if it makes you this upset, I will just sit here silently alone with my worries.
365731	366272	Finally.
368868	377565	Uh, I'll have some skirt steak, some brisket, a little piece of that New York steak, uh, a couple of them steak fingers and a burger.
377686	378748	Oh, Hank, please.
378768	379790	Have just one veggie.
380030	380672	Oh, all right.
381333	390692	Uh, put some macaroni and cheese on there, too.
390712	390792	Mmm.
394096	395698	Ooh, chocolate sauce.
395858	396900	Can I have some?
396980	398161	No, uh-uh, Bobby.
398542	399903	This is an ordinary chocolate.
400384	402026	It is laxative for your father.
403708	403768	Oh.
405250	407293	Where'd you find this chocolate sauce, Peg?
407313	408134	It sure is good.
408895	410036	Here, Bobby, try some.
410357	411959	Okay, I thought you'd never ask.
412319	415143	Bobby, Bobby, uh, you know what that is.
416364	416685	So?
417385	417846	What is it?
418186	419428	Laxative.
420657	422500	You're trying to drug me?
422560	425023	Good God, that's going too far.
425103	426625	Well, you won't talk to me about it.
427166	430911	Now, what if it really is something serious, like polyps or worse?
431272	432413	You should see a doctor.
433354	435537	Stop making such a big deal out of it.
435598	437600	I just can't go to the bathroom.
448095	450478	Oh, my...
452551	454533	He looks like an angel.
455975	460119	A dead angel.
460840	463583	It should have been Bill.
465084	468948	Hank, we never got a chance to talk about your constipation.
469189	471171	And now, we never will.
471611	474314	Remember, early detection is the key.
475055	477057	Now pass in your algebra homework.
482858	483444	Goodbye, boy.
483485	486456	See you in hell!
494485	495586	Oh!
495606	496287	Occupied!
496347	497268	Hike!
497949	498570	You're alive!
498790	500192	Close the damn door!
500272	501834	Can't you see I'm in here, Peg?
502214	503676	No, don't touch me!
503736	504617	I'm on the John!
504737	505478	Get out of here!
505538	507560	Hike, I was so scared!
508041	509202	I dreamed you died!
509482	510704	You didn't see a doctor!
510964	512286	You didn't listen to Coop!
512446	514709	Peggy, you're not supposed to see this!
515029	515970	Listen, honey...
515950	516691	I love you.
517052	518173	Please don't die on me.
518534	521018	I love you too, but oh, jeez.
521098	524663	All right, I'll see a doctor if you just get out and leave me be.
524723	526646	You will?
527568	527968	Oh, Hank.
529090	530052	Oh, well, that's wonderful.
530332	531414	Yeah, well, come on.
531474	532255	Get a move on.
532275	534418	Oh, thank you.
534879	535199	Get!
540267	544033	And what exactly are you seeing Dr. Morley about today?
544216	552208	Uh, uh, well, I've been, uh, or, uh, actually, I haven't been... Sir, you're going to have to speak up.
552228	562744	I-I need to see him about a, uh, problem with, uh... Sir, just fill this out and have a seat.
565449	566630	Oh!
566650	568633	Bobby, put that down, you do not know where it's been, honey.
568834	571017	Come on, I'm trying to fill this thing out.
576599	577220	Hanky.
577760	578961	Mrs. McIntosh?
579502	580543	Hank Hill.
581544	582865	Is this your family?
584006	586588	I was your father's third grade teacher.
587029	587129	Oh?
587589	588870	Why are you here, Hanky?
589491	591553	This is an old person's doctor.
591573	593515	Well, Hank hasn't been able to take a... A walk.
594416	596518	I threw my knee out playing touch football.
596838	598159	Mr. Hill, I'm sorry, sir.
598259	599200	I cannot read this.
599300	600041	What does it say?
600181	600501	Con?
601022	601542	Contact?
601782	602243	Contact?
602263	603064	Con what?
603084	603484	Uh...
606569	608233	So how are we doing today?
608293	609816	I'm Dr. Morley.
609856	613304	Let's see, so you're suffering from consumption?
613565	614427	Constipation.
615229	616371	Oh, constipation.
616411	618476	Well, that's quite a different matter.
618496	621523	How long has it been since your last bowel movement?
621638	628924	Well, uh, I usually don't keep track of that kind of thing, but... Five days, and Hank's usual schedule is ever two days.
629345	632227	Of course, when we were first married, he'd go every day.
632287	635630	But then I spoke to his mother, and she said the most interesting thing.
635910	640334	She said when he was a teenager, he would be in that bathroom three or four times a day... Maggie!
640494	642996	Please, Mr. Hill, this is helpful.
643597	648361	Now, your wife is obviously concerned, and if she's concerned, I'm concerned.
649021	650903	I think we'll do a sigmoidoscopy.
653397	655078	Say, honey, aren't you glad we're here?
656480	657240	Hi, Mr. Hill.
657280	659562	Why don't you go ahead and take off your pants for me, OK?
670092	670812	Why are you stopping?
671073	673295	Well, no sense in doing this now.
673655	675497	I'll just wait until the doctor comes back.
676317	679220	Sir, you're going to need to take your pants off for Dr. Morley.
681542	682763	OK.
684869	689594	Well, look at that, pig.
690916	691797	Cotton balls.
693659	694199	White ones.
696662	697844	Whole jar of them.
699545	701468	How many do you think there are in there?
703810	704791	I'll bet 30.
706633	707194	Yep.
709256	709797	30.
714215	719721	Okay, Mr. Hill, why don't you hop on the table and undo the back of your gown and we'll have a look at you.
720001	721903	You got all these fancy machines.
722023	723945	Can't you take a picture through the gown?
724226	726228	It's normal to be a little frightened, Mr. Hill.
727029	728330	Just turn your face to the wall.
729892	730833	Oh, you want me to get that?
731093	731434	No.
732915	733476	Mr. Hill?
733696	734797	Mr. Hill, this is Tasha.
734957	735818	She's a medical student.
736399	738681	Would it be all right with you if she observes the examination?
739222	741184	Uh, well, I guess.
746935	748678	We made it, honey.
749179	750501	Quick, 6-4, maternity.
750521	766366	Mr. Hill, this is a special camera that we use to get an inside view of your colon.
766386	767708	Just kill me now.
768229	770112	Mr. Hill, do you wish a bite plate?
770953	772015	Mom, I'm hungry.
775522	776825	Bobby, get outta here!
776845	777786	No, Mr. Hill.
778187	781373	When a family faces an illness, all members should be involved.
781734	783758	Remember, they're your get-well team.
784419	785040	Hey there, Ace.
785421	786483	Do you like video games?
786864	787245	Yeah.
787345	789830	Well, this joystick is just like a video game joystick.
790270	792154	Only my red button fires a real laser.
792675	794018	Cool.
794038	797204	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
797224	797344	Bobby.
797729	798711	Say, you're good.
799171	801314	Maybe you could help us out a little later.
802036	803117	Just kidding, Mr. Hill.
803999	806202	Mr. Hill, it doesn't hurt to smile.
806803	807925	It might actually help.
809046	810228	Tasha, you can begin.
814555	815797	So far, this looks normal.
816358	816778	Normal?
817119	819282	Uh, that's good, right?
819380	820602	Now, this is exciting.
820922	824707	There are so many twists and turns, I can't wait to see what's around the next bend.
824927	827870	The colon has to twist and turn because it's surprisingly long.
828311	832556	You know, Bobby, if I were to take your grandfather's intestine... I'm his father.
832616	838303	Your father's intestine and lay it out in a straight line, it would go all the way around the Earth.
838744	839845	Wow.
839865	840266	Really?
841127	843129	Well, that is amazing, Doctor.
843149	844611	You know, I did not know that.
844810	846192	Now, how could that be?
846232	849417	The Earth is 25,000 miles around.
849457	854005	A piece of steak would have to shoot through your system faster than the speed of sound.
854606	855467	That's impossible.
855848	859894	Well, Mr. Hill, there's certainly nothing going through your intestines that fast.
861276	862098	Hey, I like this.
862498	864622	Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?
866505	870531	Mr. Hill, I'm going to have to ask you to relax your buttocks for me, please.
877953	879154	How are you holding up, Mrs. Hill?
879655	880335	I'm okay.
881096	883939	I'm just a little uncomfortable from sitting here for so long.
886581	888463	Okay, let's take a five-minute break.
894189	897412	Well, Mr. Hill, we're not exactly sure what's causing your problem.
898113	900895	So at this point, the best option might be to remove something surgically.
902277	905800	I'm sorry, but apparently your low-fat, high-fiber diet is not working.
905813	909900	Well, maybe Hank just needs to give his low-fat, high-fiber diet a little more time.
910461	911522	Isn't that right, Hank?
911863	913305	Yes, yes, all right.
914327	917372	Just to be safe, I'll book an operating room for the end of the week.
917953	918854	Oh, God.
918995	919435	Don't worry.
919956	924063	You know, it's possible to live a long, healthy, slightly less active life without a colon.
925465	926607	You just can't wear shorts.
933438	934419	Not dogs.
934940	935461	Now, what are these?
935541	936141	Hot dogs?
936442	938544	No, they're not dogs.
938965	940006	They're made of tofu.
940286	940927	Tofu?
941027	942129	I can't eat that crap.
942349	943971	Then try this fofu.
944452	947135	It's a tofu substitute for the tofu intolerant.
947776	947916	Mm-hmm.
947936	950059	Now, would that be good for a man who's constipated?
950179	950519	Peggy.
950840	952081	Well, I didn't say it was you.
952582	953743	Is this for your husband?
953823	954544	Yes.
954564	956687	And we will also take a quarter of your brown rice broth.
957187	958930	Do you have anything that tastes good?
959811	961393	Hmm.
961413	961673	Uh...
962935	964116	No.
964136	965418	Ooh, look at this, Uncle Hank.
965958	971605	Experience moxibustion with Mr. Lee, board-certified moxibustionist.
972166	974789	Relieves stress and opens the energy channels.
975409	976631	What the hell is that?
977051	979554	He sticks needles in your skin and sets them on fire.
979734	982257	Anyone ever try that on me, I'll kick his ass.
984059	985521	No, watch out behind you!
985601	985901	No!
986322	987183	Oh, God.
987323	989145	Gatorade all down his back.
990172	991114	Hank, it's two o'clock.
991354	991975	Bathroom time.
992315	994179	Peg, can I just... Bathroom time.
995621	996062	All right.
998966	999768	Hi there, Peggy.
1000068	1003934	We were wondering if Hank could come out and help us with my fence.
1003954	1005257	Oh, I'm sorry, Dale.
1005277	1006799	Hank is having his bathroom time.
1007260	1011066	Maybe later.
1034688	1050046	Well, thank you all for coming.
1050707	1053690	I thought it would help cheer Hank up to have all of his friends here.
1054371	1056053	I think he's making a lot of progress.
1056493	1057775	Well, where are you going, Hank?
1058075	1058556	To the bathroom.
1059457	1061719	Now just try to relax, Hank, and concentrate.
1062160	1063041	This could be it.
1067408	1068430	Peggy, please!
1070594	1084000	Come on, Hank.
1097547	1102173	No, no, see what I'm saying is salad don't always have to have salad in it.
1102193	1104136	See, there's potato salad in it.
1105117	1105397	Ooh.
1107099	1108922	I'm sorry, Peg, I let you down.
1109523	1110364	Let y'all down.
1110684	1111625	Don't you worry, Hank.
1112186	1119015	We still have 24 hours before your appointment, and we're gonna make the most of it.
1146417	1149141	You know, Hank seems a little down.
1149441	1150944	Well, he's a shell of a man.
1151404	1154749	I never thought Hank would have the willpower to give up everything he enjoyed in life.
1155070	1155991	Well, that's not Hank.
1156311	1156812	That's me.
1157213	1162000	I mean, if it was up to him, he'd still be eating burgers in the backyard with Dale, Bill, and BoomHour.
1162360	1169691	He'd still be drinking beer and shouting at the TV set and having a lot of fun.
1176218	1176720	Wait here.
1179250	1179491	So?
1180214	1181018	So what?
1181198	1187022	Well, I heard a... I mean, I wasn't listening, but I did hear a... Oh, that was my glasses.
1188959	1190601	Look, honey, we gotta talk.
1191483	1194407	I know you want to help, but this is getting out of control.
1195007	1197551	You can't treat a grown man like a baby.
1198012	1198693	It ain't right.
1199233	1206844	I feel like I've been trying to be someone else lately, eating food I don't eat, and I'm just not gonna do it anymore.
1207305	1210649	And if I don't ever poop again, well, that's just gonna be who I am.
1211390	1215816	I'd rather die with a burger in my colon than live and eat foe-foo.
1216617	1218460	Hank, I know and.
1218997	1219919	It's okay, you're right.
1220500	1220721	What?
1221302	1226272	Well, I'm only doing this because I want you to be around as long as possible because I love you.
1227194	1229378	But I have to let you be you.
1229418	1231943	Oh, thank you.
1232685	1234990	I'll still be here for a good long while.
1235150	1235671	I worry.
1236272	1236994	I know you do.
1237134	1238136	That you could.
1238740	1239741	I know, honey.
1240342	1242565	And I'm a lucky son of a gun, I tell you what.
1243126	1248032	To have a woman like you care so much about me, I'm gonna be more open.
1248552	1250034	Tell you how I'm doing more.
1250074	1251676	And let you in.
1253058	1255822	I just want this moment to last forever, Hank.
1256062	1256623	Me too.
1258966	1259706	But it can't.
1260047	1261969	Oh, hold me, Hank.
1261989	1262210	No.
1262730	1262971	No.
1263531	1263972	Let go.
1264112	1264933	Let go.
1271933	1276813	Hmm.
1300402	1327270	you might have noticed in tonight's episode there was some brief nudity now as an actor I only do nudity when I feel the script warrants it and I thought tonight's episode only warranted seeing the side of my rump you can believe me when I tell you the Fox executives were pushing for a whole lot more if any of you were offended by my body I'm truly sorry good night
