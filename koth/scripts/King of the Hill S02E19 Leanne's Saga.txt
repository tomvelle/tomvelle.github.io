You know, I am a substitute teacher.
I would be happy to substitute for your mama while she's in prison.
Thanks, Aunt Paggy.
But I don't think mama would want anyone to tag her place.
Unless they took her place in prison.
But I guess that's too much to ask.
We did good, son.
It's beautiful.
We did it!
We finished making dad's new workbench.
Look!
No splinters.
What should we build first, son?
Well, how about a go-kart?
Okay.
First, we'll work out the design flaws of your go-kart by building a TV cabinet.
Mama, get out of prison!
Oh, I knew it.
I just knew it.
I told them media security would not be enough to hold that woman.
Oh, she didn't escape.
She was released.
She's coming to visit on Saturday.
Uh, she's coming here?
I can't wait to tell daddy.
Oh, I gotta be a family again.
I will tongue kiss Bill before I let that tramp in my house.
Whoa.
Yeah, I was all set to start on a TV cabinet on Saturday, but it's gonna have to wait a day.
Luann's mama's coming to visit.
That woman is a menace to society.
Well, I don't know, I never met the lady, but she did her time.
I tell you what, man, ain't no dang ol' lady about her, man.
Ain't gettin' ol' licked up, man, on comin' on strong, that paw me like a dang ol' animal, man.
I'll tell them no means no.
Yeah, Leanne's bad news, I tell you what.
Peggy's brother was all set to marry a pretty pharmacist gal until Leanne entertained at his bachelor party.
So, he marries Leanne, and after 18 years of drunken hell, she stabs him with a fork.
Hmm.
My foot, I think it's broken.
Well, if it's broken, you're gonna have to get that shoe off.
No, no, I feel better now.
I'm just gonna go on home.
Don't be silly.
Just let me.
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.
I never thought I'd say this, but I don't think I can finish my beer.
It's some kind of athlete's foot.
I've been using this spray for 10 years.
Quick work in my ass.
What did the doctor say?
The only person I ever showed my toes to was my ex-wife.
She used them against me in the divorce.
You don't have to be embarrassed about your toes, Bill.
It's just a medical condition.
Sure, that's what you say.
When I don't see you waving your narrow urethra around for everyone to see.
Daddy, give her another chance.
Okay.
We're never going to be a family again Aunt Peggy.
He won't forgive Mama.
Honey, marriage is about trust.
And she?
Well, she betrayed him.
It was like a knife in his heart when she stuck that fork in his back.
That was the old Mama.
She's a new Mama quit drinking.
But she won't even eat with a fork.
Oh, Luanne, I am just so proud of everything you've accomplished since we took you in.
You're in school.
You've got a righteous Christian puppet show.
You're always so very clean.
I just do not want you to get distracted and lose your way, honey.
Oh, you don't have to worry about me Aunt Peggy.
That's my mama's job.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Don't look her in the eye.
And if I give you this signal, run to Dale's house and stay there till I say it's safe.
She's here!
Mama!
Lou, Lou!
Oh, my sweet baby girlfriend!
Thanks for the lift, Alicia.
All right, Dan.
It's the hell family.
Leigh Ann, how very nice to see you.
You have such a lovely home here.
Of course, if somebody turned on a fire hose, it would all be ruined.
Yeah.
So, do you have a job?
No.
And Lulu said the trailers wrecked, so I guess I'm currently unresidented.
Why don't you stay here?
Bobby.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable in some kind of a halfway house or institution?
Please!
I'll clean up after her!
That's okay, Lulu.
I am so sorry for all the grief I caused you when I was drinking.
I am walking with the Lord now, and I know I have found his forgiveness.
I just hope I will find yours someday.
Well, we'll let you know.
Oh, Mama.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby doll.
We're getting apart, but Mama, I quit school and I'll get a job.
Oh, baby.
You mean it?
OK, then.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You will not quit school.
Leanne, you can stay here until you find a job to support yourself.
Oh, bless you, Pat.
I won't even stay in the house.
I was sleeping in the garage.
What?
No, my workbench.
You can't stay out there.
I'll fix that real nice for you, mama.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Well, what choice did we have?
Dr. Eskimea, Dr. Eskimea, please come to X-ray.
Norman Schwartzkopf?
Uh, yep.
Okay Norman, you have a common toe fungus.
Just take one of these pills every day and you'll be good as new.
I've been living with this nightmare for ten years and all I gotta do is take these pills.
Yeah, that's right.
Now you gotta take them on a full stomach.
Can do!
And absolutely no alcohol.
Hmm.
How long is she gonna stay here?
I am sick and tired of scrambling around to find nutritious meals that do not require a fork.
Hey Leanne, how's that job search coming along?
Not so good.
My best reference just went in for chemical castration.
Mama, I wanted to meet my Buckley.
Well, he's just gorgeous!
Oh, fail these muscles!
I gotta go.
Thanks for the ride!
Look!
Twin dresses!
I got them fresh to wear to my very first mother-daughter makeover night at the beauty academy.
I will meet you there after your classes tonight.
I'm gonna go shower and shave right now.
Close the door this time.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
What a great day, huh?
What a great day to be alive.
Hey, who wants to play some hacky-sack?
I do.
I'll start.
You're a hacky.
Oh, do you see that over there?
Where'd it go?
Oh, there it is.
I got it.
Well, we're all really happy that your toe fungus died, but we don't want to look at your feet every five minutes, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, hi.
You must be Lou Ann's mom, huh?
That's funny.
Most people think me and Lou Lou are sisters.
Would you do me?
Huh?
Well, don't be shy.
I'm running late.
Bear, you know how long it's been since I had a drink?
391 days.
I've been sober the whole time.
Well, help yourself.
I was just going to surprise Hank and leave him in his fridge.
I'm not allowed to have any alcohol.
Doctor's orders.
Me either.
Court orders.
I can't be around any of my old friends because all they do is drink.
Mine too.
I guess you and me are just going to have to make new friends, huh?
Miss Platter, where is this mother you've been going on and on about?
Oh, she's on her way.
Yeah, sure.
So you like being in the army?
Oh yeah, I love it.
I love it.
They tell us when to get up, what to wear, when to eat.
They take all the guests worked out of living.
Well, that's kind of like prison.
The best part was the food.
Three meals a day.
Yeah, us too.
Did y'all have those meal trays?
Yeah, five compartments.
Oh, we only have four.
Well, that follows you in there to be punished.
What is that clear nail polish?
I just love a man who takes care of his feet.
Well, you only get two.
Well, did you know there's a spot on your foot that's connected to every part of your whole body?
You want me to show you?
You won't touch my feet.
How else can I show you, silly?
I could just rub these all night.
Oh, I don't know.
Me having my feet rubbed all night by a pretty girl and feeling not okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
Bill, there are some things you don't do in another man's garage.
As of right now, Leanne is kicked out.
Hey, Hank, see, our relationship is just starting.
It's too soon to ask her to move into my house.
We'd be moving faster than the speed of love.
Please?
All right.
Dang it.
At this rate, my new workbench is never going to get used.
Oh, it got used last night.
Huh?
Right after we took a little ride on your mower.
Oh!
I got so scared when he didn't show up.
I thought you started drinking again and got an accident or a gun fight.
I'm so sorry, honey girl.
I just lost track of the time.
Forgive me.
Please, close the door.
Well, we still have today.
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
Oh, me and Billy Dee are going out to celebrate today.
So, it's called the manger baby and it's about the animal that lived in Jesus' manger.
Honey.
There's a donkey.
Honey, honey, honey.
Billy is the first good thing to happen to me since I met your daddy.
After all I've been through, don't you want me to be happy?
Of course I do.
Well, I knew you'd understand.
I would love to see your show, Luanne.
Great!
You can save a seat for Mama in case she changes her mind.
I've been watching you for days now, baby.
I just love your succuents now, baby.
You know my love will never stop now, baby.
Just put your loving in my heart.
Hey, Billy, let's go on down to Uglies and show off how in love we are.
Yeah, I'd like that.
But I'm all tapped out to my next paycheck.
We even spent my mad money.
Well, that's okay.
Foot rubs are free.
You're spoiling me.
You were dead.
Yes, I know that I am.
Now, you leave Magic Finger gonna... Oh, God, what is that?
What?
Oh!
Oh, that's just a little fungus.
So...
What are lily magic fingers gonna do to you?
Fungus.
How do you get fungus?
Don't worry about it.
As soon as I get paid, I'm gonna get my prescription refilled and that'll clear up just like that.
Now, you're not gonna let little fungus come between me, sir.
I'll just get some arm in a while.
Come in, Giddy.
Now normally I'd use a clamp for this, but you'll do in a pinch.
Okay.
If you want me to hold it tight, say T. If you want me to hold it real tight, say R-T.
That'll be our system.
All right.
T. Ow!
Dang it!
I need my workbench.
What the?
Bobby, red alert!
Get over to Dales and lock the doors!
Move!
Puggy!
Puggy, it's Leanne.
She's right here.
Uh, hey.
Bill was just inviting us to a barbecue.
Why?
I mean, what's the occasion?
We're engaged.
It was supposed to be a surprise!
I need a smoke.
This is the happiest day of my life.
uh bill how should i put this you know lian's first husband is hiding out on an oil rig in the gulf and he swears he's not coming ashore until i fax him her death certificate now what makes you think you're going to do any better because she loves me then why did she hit you oh that that why that's just a new love game we made up yesterday it's not
One of my favorites, but she seems to like it.
This goes without saying, Bill, but just in case it doesn't, I am saying that you all cannot live in my garage.
Oh, she's moving in with me today.
My house is big enough for the two of us.
Maybe even more.
Hi, Aunt Peggy.
Look what I got.
What did you do?
Mama's gonna love it.
I will not have you running around all glammed up like Phyllis Diller.
You're not my mama.
Mama is my mama.
Luanne, you are never gonna see her for what she is.
Well, I am sorry, but I have not got time for the pain.
The next time that woman breaks your heart, I am not gonna be waiting there to say, I told you so.
Why won't you give mama a chance?
She just really needs us to believe in her.
I believe in her, Luanne.
I asked her to marry me.
You're going to marry Mama?
This is like a fairy tale.
I'm going to call you step daddy Belle.
You see it, Peggy.
I'm not the only one who thinks Mama can change.
They grow up so fast.
Hey, hey, hey fellas, what happened to your eye?
I owe I owe that that that's an interesting story that you know what I was walking as walking and I walked into a door Wait a minute.
How is that interesting?
I'm hungry.
Where's the bride to be?
Oh, she'll be out soon.
She just has the free engagement party jitters.
Some kind of damn jitters.
Well, hey everybody!
Welcome to the party!
Hey!
Here she is!
Woo!
Let's get it on!
Oh, no!
What should we do?
Well, I am gonna go close up the mustard before it crusts.
If you'll excuse me.
Okay, if she gets out of hand, I'll go high.
You guys go low.
I'm ready for pepper spray.
50% capsaicum.
Mama, maybe you should eat something.
Well, where's the damn food?
The fungus for brains already gobbled it all up.
Gobble up.
Yeah.
Hey, boys, she's back.
Give it up for Leely.
Poor Bill.
His woman is making a fool of him.
It happens.
Mama, please!
Will you quit calling me that?
I might be 34.
Woo!
Little A's!
I want to go home.
Thank God.
Hey!
Come on Stan!
Show me some love!
Help!
Get this skank off me!
Mark!
You pimped it little!
Excuse me ma'am, but that was my boy.
Or Peggy, she's dead.
Leanne, whether you like the title or not, you are this girl's mother.
She has been waiting her whole life for just a shred of attention from you, but you don't know how to return even a fraction of the love that you get from your child or from your man.
I hope someday you can live without alcohol.
But until that day, we can all live very nicely without you.
Peggy, thank you for that.
I'm sorry.
I've been acting pretty foolish everyone.
You can let go of my hand.
I'll kick your brother's ass and I will kick yours too, Stacey!
Well, there's one thing that you didn't count on.
My brother has got the six feet.
But I don't!
Oh yeah!
Come on, man.
Let's get out of this dump.
How?
Think you're better than me, huh?
Fine!
Then I ain't your sister no more!
Well, I guess we can start eating.
You can't just let her steal your truck, Bill.
You gotta call the police.
No, I think the best thing to do is just let her go.
If she doesn't come back, it means we were never meant to be.
And if she does come back, well, then I'll call the police.
You kicked her ass, Mom.
Yes, I did.
But she's a better dancer.
You do not know that.
What should I do about Mr. Dyche, Chief?
He keeps introducing me as his daughter.
Well, the parental bond is extremely strong, even if it's not real.
You know, the aunt and niece bond is even stronger.
I think so too.
Twin sisters may have they strongest bond.
Especially if they're attached at the head.
And next would be the aunt and niece bond.
Strongest is the aunt niece attached at the head.
Well, I don't know how that would happen, but yes, that would be very, very strong.
