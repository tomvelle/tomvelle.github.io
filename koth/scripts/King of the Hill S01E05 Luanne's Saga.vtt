WEBVTT

00:36.835 --> 00:37.756
Just two more.

00:37.896 --> 00:38.557
Come on.

00:39.018 --> 00:40.019
Okay.

00:40.039 --> 00:40.900
Five more.

00:40.960 --> 00:41.200
Okay.

00:42.021 --> 00:42.662
Five more.

00:42.702 --> 00:45.045
Hey, you said two.

00:45.325 --> 00:46.727
You can't predict this tape.

00:47.127 --> 00:48.229
I've done it enough to know.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.471
My Game Boy's out of batteries.

00:50.772 --> 00:52.154
I need to get on the Nintendo.

00:52.534 --> 00:52.834
Quick!

00:53.195 --> 00:54.136
Just a minute, Bobby.

00:54.997 --> 00:57.961
Get ready to turn and turn.

01:00.223 --> 01:01.345
Way to go, Bobby.

01:03.808 --> 01:04.969
Hi, Uncle Hank.

01:05.354 --> 01:06.656
Uh, shut that off.

01:07.497 --> 01:10.020
Bobby, stop dancing now.

01:10.481 --> 01:12.003
He is not just dancing.

01:12.304 --> 01:14.567
He's firming his thighs and tightening his buttocks.

01:14.767 --> 01:15.568
Watch your mouth.

01:17.871 --> 01:18.332
Jesus.

01:18.352 --> 01:18.993
Ah!

01:19.013 --> 01:19.594
Ah!

01:19.614 --> 01:20.475
Jack!

01:20.916 --> 01:21.597
Lou Anne!

01:22.037 --> 01:22.798
Ah, damn it.

01:23.519 --> 01:25.542
Ah, look at this place.

01:25.562 --> 01:26.884
What is it, Uncle Hank?

01:26.904 --> 01:29.688
The sofa beds in the out position.

01:30.389 --> 01:32.712
And I can't find nothing in here anymore.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.922
What are you looking for?

01:33.942 --> 01:36.927
I didn't used to have to be looking for something.

01:37.448 --> 01:39.471
I'd come into my den and just look.

01:39.752 --> 01:43.158
Look at my different stuff and get ideas about what I want.

01:43.418 --> 01:44.580
Don't worry, Uncle Hank.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.762
I'll be out of your hair soon.

01:45.782 --> 01:49.008
I think Buckley's gonna ask me to move in.

01:49.669 --> 01:50.190
Isn't it neat?

01:51.192 --> 01:54.397
I'll be going from daddy to you to Buckley.

01:54.778 --> 01:57.282
Yeah, it's an amazing journey, Lou Ann.

01:57.548 --> 01:58.893
What about this?

01:58.913 --> 02:00.399
Maybe you want this record?

02:00.741 --> 02:02.367
No, it doesn't work like that.

02:02.628 --> 02:04.275
How about this tackle box?

02:04.295 --> 02:08.773
Luanne, what did I just... Well, that might need reorganizing.

02:20.228 --> 02:23.152
Why do you let Luan go out with that hairball?

02:23.172 --> 02:24.193
It's none of my business.

02:24.473 --> 02:25.475
She's not my daughter.

02:26.236 --> 02:29.960
Anyway, that Buckley may be dumb as dirt, but he's her ticket out of my house.

02:39.352 --> 02:39.993
Keep going!

02:40.033 --> 02:43.317
They should be out of my sight by now.

02:48.123 --> 03:04.444
And, man, in Dangle Birds, man, flying low this season, man, it's probably a dangle awkward, man, to take a look.

03:04.464 --> 03:05.805
What the hell was that?

03:06.426 --> 03:07.728
That was a breakup.

03:08.609 --> 03:11.953
At least that's what it was the last time I ran into the house crying.

03:15.410 --> 03:28.386
A lot of tears.

03:29.968 --> 03:31.490
Guess what was on sale?

03:31.971 --> 03:33.233
Oh, my lord, you've been dumped.

03:33.253 --> 03:37.278
Oh, there, there.

03:37.298 --> 03:43.105
All right, you tell Aunt Peggy all about it.

03:51.455 --> 04:01.087
Fish sticks?

04:03.991 --> 04:04.711
Oh.

04:06.053 --> 04:08.296
Hey, you know, I was almost killed at this point.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.177
Okay, Hank, please.

04:09.217 --> 04:10.799
Try and be sensitive.

04:13.683 --> 04:14.464
Okay, honey.

04:14.484 --> 04:15.585
Go ahead, you let it out.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.167
It is natural.

04:17.187 --> 04:18.829
This is the healing process.

04:20.632 --> 04:25.098
Peggy.

04:25.559 --> 04:26.680
I had a talk with her today.

04:26.721 --> 04:30.746
We are past the first hump, so that leaves only seven more humps.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.869
Peggy, I need you to fix her now.

04:33.370 --> 04:37.175
Without my quiet time, I'm not an effective propane salesman.

04:37.335 --> 04:38.998
Well, you can't rush it, Hank.

04:39.018 --> 04:44.005
The formula is, for however long she was dating him, that's how long it takes to get over him.

04:44.145 --> 04:46.488
You mean we got three more weeks of this?

04:46.849 --> 04:49.272
If you don't fix her, I'll have to.

04:49.252 --> 04:52.136
Well, honey, I don't think you have the tools for that job.

04:52.296 --> 04:53.398
What's that supposed to mean?

04:53.939 --> 04:58.686
Well, remember when my aunt died and you kept grabbing me around the waist and saying, let's wrestle.

04:58.986 --> 05:00.508
Yeah, but you told me that helped you.

05:00.909 --> 05:01.210
I did.

05:01.650 --> 05:02.652
Well, yes, it did.

05:03.072 --> 05:03.353
See?

05:03.813 --> 05:08.120
Look, if you really want to help, sometime tomorrow you tell Louie and she looks pretty.

05:08.420 --> 05:10.203
What's that got to do with anything?

05:10.343 --> 05:12.166
She just needs to hear it from a man.

05:12.486 --> 05:16.592
Three words, you look pretty and nothing more.

05:17.737 --> 05:19.821
So whatcha thinkin' about there, Stu?

05:20.081 --> 05:22.245
I'm thinkin' about flippin' that steak there.

05:22.606 --> 05:23.187
Well, ratty.

05:23.547 --> 05:23.968
No!

05:24.148 --> 05:25.190
Flip that other one!

05:25.551 --> 05:28.856
Don't go away.

05:28.876 --> 05:36.790
We'll be right back with more of Make a Steak.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.672
How you doin' out there?

05:37.932 --> 05:38.954
I'm Chuck Manjoni.

05:39.495 --> 05:42.360
You know, even celebrities have to hunt for bargains.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.893
That's why I go to the Megalomark, where shopping feels so good.

05:47.493 --> 05:51.777
This week, twelve five pound bags of gourmet chocolates for ten dollars.

05:52.258 --> 06:12.195
That's Buckley's section.

06:12.935 --> 06:14.056
You look pretty.

06:14.797 --> 06:15.778
I was dumped.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.821
Three words, nothing more.

06:19.141 --> 06:20.362
You look pretty.

06:20.883 --> 06:21.584
Nothing more.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.607
Why aren't you saying anything?

06:27.089 --> 06:28.591
I never liked that Buckley.

06:29.011 --> 06:29.872
You should be happy.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.395
That guy was an annoying greasy headed loser.

06:34.016 --> 06:37.980
I was dumped by a loser.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.897
Ah, jeez.

06:41.917 --> 06:45.281
Luanne, sometimes life throws you a curveball.

06:45.301 --> 06:47.223
Now there's two ways you can deal with it.

06:47.784 --> 06:54.351
You can cry, and that's the path you've chosen, or you can not cry.

06:54.391 --> 06:56.854
How do you not cry?

06:56.874 --> 07:01.639
Well, instead of letting it out, try holding it in.

07:02.520 --> 07:08.507
Every time you have a feeling, just stick it into a little pit inside your stomach and never let it out.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.809
Are you supposed to have a pain under your rib?

07:15.069 --> 07:15.430
Yes.

07:16.111 --> 07:17.012
That's natural.

07:17.413 --> 07:20.257
The body doesn't want to swallow its emotions.

07:20.858 --> 07:24.242
But now you go ahead and put that pain inside your stomach, too.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.546
I think it's working, Uncle Hank.

07:27.627 --> 07:30.251
I feel sick, but not sad.

07:30.591 --> 07:31.212
There you go.

07:31.272 --> 07:33.175
Look at my friend Bill.

07:33.235 --> 07:38.022
He went through the worst divorce this county's ever seen, but you never see him crying.

07:40.246 --> 07:48.720
I'm scared I'll never find another guy.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.142
Ah, don't worry about that.

07:50.683 --> 07:51.344
Peggy told me.

07:51.945 --> 07:56.192
If you dated your old boyfriend for three weeks, you'll get a new one in three weeks.

07:56.452 --> 07:57.073
Tops.

07:58.032 --> 08:04.681
Another thing I hate about Buckley, he always takes me to all you can eat and says that I have to sneak off his plate so I just get iced tea.

08:05.362 --> 08:07.284
And then he's too scared to get caught to share.

08:07.585 --> 08:09.828
Ooh, I hate guys like that.

08:10.148 --> 08:13.072
And why do boys with braces always want a french kiss?

08:14.434 --> 08:18.860
Uh, pass me some more of that cookie dough.

08:22.525 --> 08:22.605
Mmm.

08:23.277 --> 08:24.841
I never knew you could eat it raw.

08:25.502 --> 08:27.046
It's almost as good as ice cream.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.595
You know they make ice cream with cookie dough already in it.

08:30.615 --> 08:36.409
Damn sister get me my keys.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.331
Lou Ann, where have you been?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.374
We were supposed to be crying all night.

08:40.614 --> 08:42.536
I spent the whole day with Uncle Hank.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.780
Lou Ann, why don't you go get the fold out ready?

08:46.120 --> 08:46.521
OK.

08:46.921 --> 08:48.563
Good night, Uncle Hank and Aunt Peggy.

08:49.004 --> 08:50.145
Good night, Hank.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.026
What did you do?

08:51.046 --> 08:53.048
I did what you couldn't do.

08:53.088 --> 08:55.892
Now, I'm not saying you're not good at what you do.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.553
I'm just saying I'm better.

08:58.214 --> 09:00.917
I went in there and fixed her like fixing a carburetor.

09:01.398 --> 09:02.039
And you know what?

09:02.139 --> 09:04.962
It was fun, like fixing a carburetor.

09:04.942 --> 09:06.926
But Hank, I told you not to meddle.

09:07.447 --> 09:11.214
This is a natural process and you cannot manipulate... You know, you look pretty.

09:12.216 --> 09:12.536
Really?

09:13.879 --> 09:14.600
Oh, Hank.

09:15.161 --> 09:16.043
Well, that's sweet.

09:17.005 --> 09:19.429
But I mean it, you have got to stop... You look pretty, Peg.

09:20.972 --> 09:21.533
Oh, thank you.

09:32.887 --> 09:34.129
You ladies go on ahead.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.293
We gotta help Bill close his jeans.

09:38.217 --> 09:39.559
All right, let's go.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.745
All right, we have to find a nice boyfriend for Lou Ann.

09:43.306 --> 09:46.592
Boy, that seems like a pile of work just to get your den back.

09:46.872 --> 09:48.455
Well, it's not about my den.

09:48.515 --> 09:51.040
It's about that poor girl living in my den.

09:51.681 --> 09:52.903
So what's your type?

10:00.038 --> 10:02.200
Uh, never mind about her type.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.882
Just find a regular guy.

10:04.263 --> 10:08.107
It's a scientific fact that women like round muscular butts.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.630
I'm gonna look for a guy with a round muscular butt.

10:13.472 --> 10:15.515
Uh, maybe we should split up.

10:16.295 --> 10:17.176
Oh, one more thing.

10:17.717 --> 10:18.998
Peggy doesn't know about this.

10:19.479 --> 10:20.700
Oh, you want me to tell her?

10:21.681 --> 10:22.322
No, Bill.

10:22.943 --> 10:23.824
Just dance with her.

10:24.144 --> 10:25.185
Keep her busy.

10:25.503 --> 10:26.585
What, me?

10:27.046 --> 10:27.767
Dancing?

10:27.787 --> 10:29.851
I don't know, I don't know.

10:30.412 --> 10:43.275
My arms around a warm, okay.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.038
Hmm.

10:48.324 --> 10:48.685
Nah.

10:48.865 --> 10:48.945
Hmm.

10:50.191 --> 10:50.792
Possible.

10:51.472 --> 10:52.914
Dale, I bought you a beer.

10:53.474 --> 10:54.695
Mind if I dance with your wife?

10:55.116 --> 10:55.516
Take her.

10:59.140 --> 10:59.560
Sucker.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.523
Y'all know, man, he ain't gonna have to worry about that.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.725
If you go out and dance, she's gonna go Dutch, man.

11:04.745 --> 11:06.087
Something to know of the way.

11:06.107 --> 11:07.248
Well, you smell nice.

11:07.949 --> 11:09.670
Dance with me, sugar?

11:09.690 --> 11:10.831
Hey, boy, take what, man?

11:10.851 --> 11:12.473
That ain't over CK1, man.

11:12.493 --> 11:16.497
It's like catnip.

11:16.517 --> 11:19.540
Hey, you seem like a regular guy.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.618
Hi, what's Hank doing over there?

11:26.638 --> 11:28.924
Well, I don't see him.

11:28.944 --> 11:31.651
Bill, why are you spinning me into souvenir gold?

11:32.133 --> 11:34.058
Been a while, I can't remember all the steps.

11:34.358 --> 11:36.544
Well, just do what I say and we'll get along fine.

11:37.025 --> 11:40.735
On three, brush, wrap and fan, lift and scoop, scrape and scoop.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.572
What's your name, son?

11:49.012 --> 11:49.613
Wade, sir.

11:50.234 --> 11:51.675
That's some buckle you got there.

11:52.016 --> 11:52.576
Thank you, sir.

11:52.937 --> 11:57.683
It means a lot coming from a man like you who, I can plainly see, knows a thing or two about buckles.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.007
Well, uh, well, this round's on me.

12:01.948 --> 12:03.029
Fangeric by left.

12:03.249 --> 12:03.810
Hitch right.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.612
Fan fan, double dog down.

12:05.832 --> 12:07.414
Hitch kick now, select that heel.

12:07.434 --> 12:10.418
Heel toe, heel toe, heel toe, knee toe heel.

12:10.398 --> 12:11.760
Quarterback, huh?

12:11.780 --> 12:12.321
Varsity.

12:12.822 --> 12:13.483
Love your mama?

12:13.743 --> 12:14.364
You know I do.

12:14.865 --> 12:16.768
She cook with a gas range?

12:16.808 --> 12:17.228
Propane.

12:19.752 --> 12:21.515
I don't know if I'm ready, Uncle Hank.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.556
Sure you are.

12:22.977 --> 12:24.399
And Wade's a catch-and-a-half.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.863
He can run the 40 in under five seconds.

12:27.744 --> 12:31.289
But my heart is telling me that... Your heart is telling you who's the boss.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.712
You or your heart.

12:32.732 --> 12:33.252
You are.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.836
Your heart is your employee.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.380
So get your heart off its butt and back to work.

12:38.765 --> 12:40.026
You're right, Uncle Hank.

12:40.306 --> 12:41.307
What am I waiting for?

12:42.208 --> 12:43.590
Let's go get weighed.

12:47.473 --> 12:49.355
Bill, you need to have more confidence in yourself.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.458
If you ask Peggy Hill, you boot scoot with the best of them.

12:52.618 --> 12:53.920
Well, I don't know.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.023
All right, this next one's going to be ladies' choice.

12:57.643 --> 13:01.887
Excuse me, Bill.

13:01.907 --> 13:02.808
Hey, Peggy.

13:02.828 --> 13:04.009
Better than aerobics, huh?

13:04.530 --> 13:05.931
You worked up quite a sweat.

13:06.572 --> 13:07.793
That's not my sweat.

13:15.265 --> 13:16.006
Where's Luan?

13:16.427 --> 13:17.188
Luan's fine.

13:17.228 --> 13:19.231
She's gonna get her eye at home with a friend.

13:19.852 --> 13:21.334
Tush, push on three.

13:22.195 --> 13:22.897
And three.

13:28.305 --> 13:30.929
Is Luan gonna marry her new boyfriend?

13:30.949 --> 13:35.576
Well, you never can tell, but my guess is, yeah.

13:35.596 --> 13:35.856
Luan!

13:36.680 --> 13:37.702
That's buckly.

13:38.263 --> 13:39.405
Those better be for me.

13:39.846 --> 13:41.288
No, they're for me for later.

13:41.549 --> 13:42.590
Where's Luanne?

13:42.811 --> 13:44.935
Luanne is out with her new boyfriend.

13:45.415 --> 13:46.217
She's in love.

13:46.277 --> 13:47.359
You blew it, Dip Head.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.182
You can't compete with this new guy.

13:49.222 --> 13:53.089
He's a football player, and football players know how to treat women right.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.954
Now get off my lawn and don't come back.

13:57.773 --> 13:59.195
Why'd you send Buckley away?

13:59.636 --> 14:00.917
Luann wants him back.

14:01.198 --> 14:02.099
Not gonna happen.

14:02.119 --> 14:03.401
I found her a new guy.

14:03.461 --> 14:05.303
You broke the rebound rule?

14:05.744 --> 14:07.606
What has gotten into you, Hank?

14:07.626 --> 14:11.031
Well, I was kind of hoping she might fall in love with Wade.

14:11.271 --> 14:14.636
Well, hoping one hand and booing the other, see which one gets full first.

14:15.477 --> 14:16.999
Mm-mm, you are out of your depth, Hank Hill.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.022
You've opened a Pandora's box.

14:19.002 --> 14:22.569
A box that has a sign that reads, For Women Only.

14:23.250 --> 14:31.767
As long as it took that river to carve the Grand Canyon, that is how long women have been learning to subtly manipulate relationships.

14:31.787 --> 14:36.015
You only think it's easy because we make it look easy.

14:35.995 --> 14:40.803
Did you really believe you could step in and fix it overnight?

14:40.823 --> 14:43.588
Could you really be such a fool?

14:43.608 --> 14:45.751
Who is you, Hank Hill?

14:45.771 --> 14:46.312
Who is you?

14:46.412 --> 14:47.093
No, no!

14:47.594 --> 14:49.357
No, everything's gonna be fine.

14:49.978 --> 14:51.100
Wade's a good guy.

14:51.360 --> 14:51.881
You don't know.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.063
He runs fast.

14:53.484 --> 14:54.385
It'll be fine.

14:55.748 --> 14:56.569
What's that?

14:58.979 --> 14:59.340
See?

14:59.721 --> 15:00.603
Everything's fine.

15:01.144 --> 15:02.467
Good ol' Wade drove her home.

15:03.088 --> 15:05.954
Look at that, he's fixed his dodge up just like Boom Hours.

15:06.415 --> 15:08.019
Well, why on earth would anyone do that?

15:09.141 --> 15:09.863
Boom Hours?

15:12.469 --> 15:12.749
Good night.

15:13.270 --> 15:14.212
Thanks for the lift.

15:14.834 --> 15:15.435
No!

15:29.033 --> 15:31.216
Luanne, what happened to Wade?

15:31.597 --> 15:32.858
Why aren't you with Wade?

15:33.299 --> 15:34.340
I want Wade.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.925
As soon as you left, Wade turned into Mr. Grabby Sam.

15:38.586 --> 15:41.090
I think that you just fixed me up with him so you could get your den back.

15:41.671 --> 15:43.193
Thank goodness, Boomhower gave me a lift.

15:43.473 --> 15:43.874
A lift?

15:44.274 --> 15:45.936
Is that what they're calling it these days?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.019
You can't trust this guy.

15:48.039 --> 15:51.364
He's a no-good, immoral, skirt-chasing rascal.

15:51.765 --> 15:54.248
So, at least you like him better than Buckley.

15:54.228 --> 15:55.290
What are you saying?

15:55.310 --> 15:56.733
He's your new boyfriend?

15:56.793 --> 15:58.376
Hank, so what if he is?

15:58.636 --> 16:00.259
If he is, he ain't no more.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.983
Hank, you can't tell me what to do.

16:02.023 --> 16:03.125
You're not my father.

16:04.207 --> 16:05.089
Yeah, I guess not.

16:05.730 --> 16:06.812
Damn straight I'm not.

16:07.192 --> 16:09.878
But while you're under my roof, I'm your landlord.

16:10.138 --> 16:13.003
And as your landlord, I forbid you to date Boomhauer.

16:13.084 --> 16:13.885
Shut up, Hank.

16:14.086 --> 16:15.949
I can find another roof.

16:15.929 --> 16:17.391
I'll stay at Boom Howers!

16:17.752 --> 16:18.152
Fine!

16:18.333 --> 16:18.793
Fine!

16:19.334 --> 16:21.257
Wait, man, I'll just stay there and go work out, man.

16:21.277 --> 16:24.262
Those little girls come around here, they just flat-out know, man.

16:24.282 --> 16:25.103
Thanks, Boom Howers.

16:25.123 --> 16:25.704
Let's go.

16:26.505 --> 16:28.589
Dang old women from Mars, man.

16:28.609 --> 16:35.599
I'll tell you what.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.022
Don't go in there, Lou Ann.

16:37.362 --> 16:38.023
I'm warning you.

16:38.504 --> 16:39.305
You'll be sorry.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.692
Damn it, this neighborhood is turning into Melrose Place.

16:55.687 --> 16:57.772
Hank, it is after midnight.

16:57.812 --> 16:59.055
What the heck are you doing?

16:59.496 --> 17:01.641
Clearing some space from a leaf blower.

17:02.924 --> 17:03.064
Mm-hmm.

17:03.084 --> 17:06.011
Now, Hank, this is not about the leaf blower, is it?

17:06.171 --> 17:07.013
Sure it is.

17:11.144 --> 17:13.066
What are you eating?

17:13.366 --> 17:13.706
Nothing.

17:14.007 --> 17:15.708
You are eating your emotions, aren't you?

17:15.908 --> 17:16.689
Maybe who knows?

17:16.809 --> 17:17.190
I don't know.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.211
I don't care, whatever.

17:18.471 --> 17:24.356
You thought you could fix Lou Ann like a flywheel drive plate, but a flywheel drive plate doesn't talk back.

17:24.737 --> 17:27.119
Flywheel drive plates do not have feelings.

17:27.139 --> 17:29.221
Flywheel drive plates... I took her in, Peg.

17:29.341 --> 17:33.465
I put a 20-year roof over her head and a sofa sleeper under the rest of her.

17:33.805 --> 17:35.266
And this is the thanks I get?

17:35.547 --> 17:39.210
Well, no thanks.

17:39.663 --> 17:40.745
Just face it, Hank Hill.

17:41.005 --> 17:44.850
The only reason you're this upset is because you care so much about Luanne.

17:44.910 --> 17:47.414
The only thing I care about is getting my den back.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.384
Boy, I've never been in here before.

17:54.404 --> 17:56.406
Oh, it sure is bachelor-y.

17:56.446 --> 17:58.830
Can I turn this light on?

17:59.651 --> 18:02.575
Oh, uh, that's real pretty.

18:02.595 --> 18:04.237
Uh, gosh.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.662
Oh, you move very fast, boomhauer.

18:08.401 --> 18:18.614
I'm having all these feelings and I need just a little time to... Okay, last case of beer.

18:18.654 --> 18:19.677
Let's divvy it up.

18:21.023 --> 18:24.127
Hey, it don't split up even anymore.

18:24.528 --> 18:25.910
That one's Boom Howard's.

18:26.331 --> 18:28.614
That cradle robber's getting none of my beer.

18:28.854 --> 18:30.416
Boom Howard didn't do anything.

18:30.757 --> 18:32.379
And even if he did, why do you care?

18:32.659 --> 18:34.061
Lu Ann's not your relation.

18:34.222 --> 18:36.465
Hell, she's my wife's brother's daughter.

18:36.906 --> 18:38.388
You can't get any closer than that.

18:39.109 --> 18:41.192
Look, let's just split that six pack up.

18:41.252 --> 18:42.273
We can each take two.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.940
Tell you what, why don't I just take the whole thing?

18:47.040 --> 18:47.661
Okay, Mom.

18:48.021 --> 18:49.984
Let's try and move a mile.

18:50.420 --> 18:56.791
and split kick right and back and split kick left and sideways shuffle go!

18:58.074 --> 19:00.758
Oh, are you okay, Bobby?

19:01.059 --> 19:01.380
Yeah.

19:01.961 --> 19:04.585
Well, it was a nice move.

19:04.605 --> 19:06.649
Yeah.

19:06.669 --> 19:06.869
Aw, honey.

19:06.889 --> 19:09.414
It's just not right without Luan.

19:09.434 --> 19:10.015
Yeah.

19:14.585 --> 19:16.328
This was a nice idea, Pig.

19:16.668 --> 19:17.810
Get us out of that house.

19:18.631 --> 19:22.797
Son, they got eight kinds of ketchup here, and three kinds of ketchup.

19:23.619 --> 19:28.646
Not that I'm going to have some of that fried chicken, fried plate, fried chicken, fried side, fried, fried okra.

19:29.708 --> 19:30.409
Luan!

19:30.870 --> 19:32.031
And boomhauer too.

19:32.312 --> 19:34.014
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?

19:34.635 --> 19:37.740
Uh, is that gravy lumpy tonight?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.964
Hey, I'm Peggy, Uncle Hank.

19:40.184 --> 19:44.273
I'll take a bowl of the white gravy and a bowl of brown gravy.

19:44.474 --> 19:48.022
Hey, Dad, it's Luann, right behind you.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.585
Dad, it's Luann.

19:50.387 --> 19:51.850
Hey, Dad, can't you hear me?

19:52.171 --> 19:54.075
Luann, right behind you.

19:58.105 --> 20:01.410
Say, Hank, man, I don't know what you're thinking, man, but y'all got no man.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.054
I ain't no dang old Woody Allen with that little soon lead, man.

20:04.074 --> 20:05.236
This ain't nothing going to happen.

20:05.376 --> 20:08.381
Boom, Hauer, you're not going to talk your way out of this one.

20:08.822 --> 20:09.483
Uncle Hank?

20:10.564 --> 20:12.327
Don't uncle me anymore, Lou Ann.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.152
Just come on by tomorrow and pick your stuff up.

20:15.793 --> 20:17.676
I got it all boxed and ready to go.

20:21.381 --> 20:22.743
Well, you finally got your wish.

20:22.984 --> 20:24.406
You are going to get your den back.

20:24.907 --> 20:25.648
I hope you're happy.

20:29.543 --> 20:30.805
Look at she's crying again.

20:30.825 --> 20:34.829
I guess she just got dumped by her new boyfriend, Boomhauer.

20:36.131 --> 20:37.252
Boomhauer didn't dump her.

20:37.272 --> 20:37.693
You did.

20:37.933 --> 20:38.234
What?

20:38.254 --> 20:38.794
What was that?

20:39.015 --> 20:41.257
She said Boomhauer didn't dump her.

20:41.317 --> 20:41.898
You did.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.061
Pass the kids up.

20:52.531 --> 20:53.712
I came for my stuff.

20:54.033 --> 20:54.994
That's all in there.

20:57.758 --> 21:17.139
I was moving stuff around and it seems that the room looks a little better this way.

21:19.221 --> 21:20.623
The bed is keeping out.

21:20.643 --> 21:24.627
Well, I figure there's no sense in packing it up night after night.

21:24.995 --> 21:26.777
Love you, Uncle Hank.

21:28.699 --> 21:31.623
Oh, Lord.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.073
See, still looking?

21:44.317 --> 21:44.737
Yep.

21:45.358 --> 21:47.941
You know, Hank, maybe it's time to settle this.

21:48.542 --> 21:52.386
Yeah, I just hate these big emotional scenes.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.875
Well, let's get it over with.

21:56.058 --> 21:56.679
Boom hour!

21:57.340 --> 21:57.660
Yep.

21:58.442 --> 21:58.762
Beer?

22:01.207 --> 22:01.487
Yep.

22:03.932 --> 22:09.261
That was beautiful.
