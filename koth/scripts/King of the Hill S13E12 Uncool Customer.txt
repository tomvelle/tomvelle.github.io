Welcome to Speakers Music.
Can I help you find something?
Yes.
I have discovered this new singer.
His name is Michael Bublay.
He's a crooner.
Huh.
I always assumed the people who wanted to buy that type of music would do it anonymously online.
You can buy music online?
Oh, I need the cassette.
Cassette?
Hey, do you have that song that goes... Na na na na... I'm sorry, I gotta... Yeah.
If you ask me, people gave up on casignals much too quickly.
Huh.
Remember that old polygamist compound?
Looks like they turned it into a restaurant.
I had no idea.
I realize something today, Hank.
I don't move and shake the way I used to.
I'm just not as plugged in anymore.
Well, sure you're plugged in.
You're the one who told us about aloe vera.
Am I just gonna listen to the same cassettes and wear the same clothes until the day I die?
Well, not if they wear out.
Hank, I don't want to be one of those people who still writes checks at the grocery store, or wear sweatpants to the mall.
Not yet.
You know, from the dates on these tapes, I lost touch 12, no, 13 years ago.
I wonder what happened to me.
Hey, guys.
I guess we'll never know.
Hey Dad, I was thinking.
One of the things I like most about you is that you have such good manners.
Thank you.
There's this class I can take that could teach me, well, to be more like you.
What kind of class is that?
It's called Catillion.
Catillion?
Isn't that where the girls learn to curtsy and wave their handkerchiefs and whatnot?
The girls do that, and the boys learn to be little gentlemen.
And it only takes six Saturdays.
You know, Bobby, ROTC has an after-school program.
They'll teach you manners and military history.
I think that's a better option.
Here's the deal, Dad.
I'm in a dating rut.
Because of all my comedy bits, I'm in the friend zone with the girls at school.
Kids from all over Arland take Catillion classes.
It'll give me a chance to meet new girls.
If this is just an elaborate way for you to get to dress up and parade around... I'm not gonna lie to you, Dad.
I am going to love it.
But this girl problem is real.
Well, your handshake could use a firmer grip and a faster upswing.
Thanks dad!
a whole new crop of girls.
And not one of them has seen my flatulent monkey visits the post office routine.
You know, Bobby, I think the drunks say it best.
Sometimes you have to accept the things you cannot change.
Sure, you used to be up on things, and maybe those days are behind you.
But you still have value.
Huh?
Hunchin' Co.
Hunchin' Co.
She can't wait to get started.
Rafters.
What can I get for you today?
I think I'll try the meatloaf sandwich.
You think, or are you sure?
Because once I enter it in, they start making it.
Yes, one meatloaf sandwich, please.
Uh, what's the procedure to get a table?
Well, you just sit wherever there's an open chair.
We're not she-she here, it's a barn.
No, oh, there's room at the big table.
Oh, I don't think you understand, see, I'm not with those people.
No one's a stranger at the island barn.
Oh, did you hear?
With the new birth control pills, you only have to have one period a year.
That's good, because that patch makes my boobs really sensitive.
How is it?
Well, let me put it this way.
This table smells like a diaper, and this is still the best meal I've had in years.
She loves chaps.
Anyone have an aspirin?
All this clinking.
You know, for a while now, there's been something in the bottom of my purse.
It's either an aspirin or a breath mint.
Here it is.
It's covered in lint, but you can have it.
I have some French aspirin.
It's amazing.
Oh, cute!
Where did you get that?
This thing?
It was in the gift bag backstage at the Gwen Stefani concert.
There's separate compartments for Eastern and Western remedies.
Gwen thought of everything.
Ooh.
Oh, I don't know her.
I had to take my daughter, Michael.
Oh, I think you met your son, Michael.
You just said daughter.
I think you meant son.
Oh.
Your bag is delicious.
I've been looking for one.
Just like it.
I know, right?
It's made out of vintage Star Wars bedsheets.
My friend makes these.
Well, she did before she got cast on Saturday Night Live.
Wow.
And that is the proper way to remove a lady's coat.
Do not yank!
Here we go.
May I take your coat, Mias?
Eye contact?
Yes, you may.
Do not yank!
Interactions!
I'm Michael.
What if I told you my name was Amanda?
It's not.
It's Bobby.
You're funny.
That's major.
Major?
Sorry.
They use it in Britain.
It means, you know, cool.
Like perfume that smells like dirt or numbers used as letters.
Sure it's snake poison, but it lasts longer than Botox.
Ugh, judging by how long I took them to learn how to eat soup, this junk-housin could go on forever.
Who wants to go to this new wine bar, a block over?
Oh, that sounds great.
There is nothing like an afternoon chardonnay.
Uh, I'm not sure if they still have that.
They've got mostly Gruner-Velt liner and Spanish D'Wero.
Oh, well, whatever.
Pour it in a glass and throw an ice cube and I'm happy.
You're fun.
You say what you think, like you're already drinking.
Now I gotta warn you, the DJ spends tons of Danish Prague, but usually it's stuff you haven't heard.
It seems like people who already know about this place are the only ones who could ever find it.
Secrets are fun, huh, ladies?
Yeah, about that.
Can I get y'all to look away?
It's also a secret where the doorbell is.
He's trained to remove the uncool.
I'm a goner.
Okay, Peggy.
Reject them before they reject you.
I just saw my ex.
I can't go in.
We're in.
You bet I'm in.
And I am never leaving.
Michael is the coolest girl.
She uses words we know in ways that you'd never expect.
And her mother, Cat, she is so hip.
She walks with this interesting, straight-legged saunter.
I think I should start doing that.
Stop that.
Your gate is fine the way it is.
I want Michael to be my girlfriend.
And I want Cat to be my girlfriend.
Oh, I know it sounds silly, but I need a friend like Cat right now.
How great would it be to have doors open for me and people ask me what I like so they know what to like.
I would never be out of the loop again.
I'm excited for all of us.
Thank you.
I'm honored that you'd want to spend a weekend meal with us.
No offense, Bill, but I just need you guys as a buffer.
The only table that's ever open is the big table, and I want to be surrounded.
Still honored.
Go, grab it.
Yay!
Thank God.
That pregnant woman was fast, but we wanted it more.
Your surname, Babcock?
No.
It's no treat.
Huh.
You look like you're a kin of the Lubbock Babcocks.
Tell me about them.
Well, there's Johnny Babcock.
He's a racist.
Then there's Donita.
She works for the water department.
How was school today, Ms.
Goodbye?
Hunch and call.
It's improper to say goodbye unless the end of the conversation is mutually reached.
May we have the next pair, please?
Hey!
Hello!
This is Robert Hill calling for Ms.
Michael Savage.
Is she available, please?
You're speaking to Ms.
Savage?
Hello, Mr. Hill.
Oh, Mr. Hill is my father.
My friends call me Bobby.
You should call me Robert.
I know we just met the other day, but I feel like I've known you forever.
I bet in no time we will be completing each other's.
Hi again.
I want to say Penny.
Peggy.
Yeah.
I must ask, what is a contemporary woman like yourself doing in this class?
I mean, Catillion hasn't been cool for, you know, five years.
I know.
Catillion is even retro.
But Michael wants me to throw her a fancy birthday party, so she's gonna learn grace and poise and all that business.
Really?
You know who loves birthday parties?
My son Bobby.
He pins the tail in the donkey like a surgeon.
We both do.
You know, I still haven't filled up my last table, and the invites are being delivered tomorrow.
I should totally invite some of you guys.
Hey, you know what would make me happy?
A meal at the Arlen Barn with my family strategically placed around me.
Now, I warn you, people will try to talk to you, and that's fine.
Just don't pull me in.
We cannot go.
We're waiting to see if we scored an invite to the children's party of the decade.
Ah, okay.
Well, I guess I could just cover my ears with my hands, but then how would I... Headphones?
Mom, we have to get invited.
It would be the best.
It's true?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no!
You two have lost your minds.
Oh, it's just some box.
Wait a minute.
See, you are cool.
Hey, let's go celebrate with a sandwich superstar.
Oh, no.
I have a long way to go before I am cool, but I will get there.
Now, Bobby, we have to find out what's in and do by read here, wear it.
We have got to bring it to this party.
Those are great.
It's nice to see someone not want the clear frames.
I can't tell you how many people come in and get those.
They're so trendy, I mean.
I'll take the clear frames.
According to a gadgets blogger named Quailude, this is the it vacuum.
Are you sure?
This one seems more space-agey.
Oh no.
Seeing the dust swirl around is so over.
No.
Bill, the question is not if you have tried them or not, just if you have heard of them.
Sure, I've heard of them.
Cuddle parties.
No.
I have never heard of those.
Julia Roberts, niece.
Uh-uh.
Does she also laugh when she's startled?
This is asinine.
Don't you think people should like you for yourself and not because you know all this nonsense?
I cannot be myself, Hank.
I like socks and short and A. Son, son, your pants are falling down.
Here, I'll cover you.
This is the style, Dad.
Don't worry.
I'm wearing two pairs of underwear.
Think of this outer underwear as part of the pants.
How about you wear pants, and I'll think about them as pants?
Bobby, we are ready for this party.
I've even invented a word for how ready we are.
We're RISIDI!
Ugh, this is so exciting.
This'll be the first time I've ever seen Michael's bare hands.
And I am just four marble-stepping stones away from being Cat's BFF.
That is a friend one is very loyal to.
Ladies and gentlemen, making her grand entrance, the birthday girl, Michael Savage!
Hill's in the crib!
Oh, yeah!
Heavens!
My party is brilliant!
My life is over!
Michael, come back here.
Oh, this is so awful.
Maybe nobody noticed.
Erase them!
Erase them!
Violet, Caden, check everybody's cell phone!
Oh, Kat, I am so sorry.
I thought this was the appropriate attire.
Look, I know you didn't mean to show up and wreck everything I worked ten months for.
Honestly, if it wasn't this, she'd freak out about something else.
Still, I regret that we were the cause of her freakout.
And there she goes.
I gotta go coax Michael down from the treehouse again.
Y'all way ruined Michael's party!
This was supposed to be the sickest party in the world!
If this is a joke, it isn't funny like at all.
It is totally obstructive.
I'd like to order a meatloaf sandwich, please.
That won't be necessary.
I'd like it to go.
Sure.
If you'll just have a seat, we'll bring it right out to you.
Never mind.
We have got to get out of here.
I have never been that humiliated in front of that many people.
I definitely have, but still, that was pretty bad.
Someone's coming!
Quick, in here.
I don't hate Candice.
I'm just saying, her mother's a belly dancer.
Oh my god.
What is this place?
It looks like the lair of a crazy human or a smart animal.
I know, right?
Oh lord!
I swear we were not snooping.
We were just trying to find a way out.
I never wanted anyone to see this.
I don't know.
Maybe I did, since I didn't keep it locked or anything.
You're not gonna lock it now, are you?
Being as cutting edge as I am, it's a full-time job.
Seriously.
I wake up when it's still dark to watch the European news.
Then I check in with the club kids just before they go to bed.
I read 142 blogs a day every day, every hour.
And look at me, I'm texting right now.
Huh, wristbands are out.
Sure, all of this seems crazy.
But I don't know, I guess that's the price you pay for glamour.
I mean, look at this bag.
Mmm, that's an Uchi Tamagoy.
It's not coming out for three months.
I believe it.
It looks like it's from the future.
I want this bag.
That collage.
Your life.
Trust me, you don't.
See?
I follow trends, all of them.
No matter what, piercings, colonics, trendy surgeries, online affairs.
I've even done some street fighting.
You think Cat Savage is my real name?
It's not.
It's Barb Davis.
And now, I'm free.
I do not understand.
I knew I was drawn to you for a reason.
I must have had a subconscious need to break away from all this.
Oh, so I am so uncool.
I snapped you out of your hip trance.
Exactly.
Peggy, you aren't driven by trends or fashion or snarky websites.
You don't need to be.
You are your own person.
And I think that's way cool.
Well, come to think of it, so do I. So, what are regular people into these days?
For starters, we buy all our makeup at the grocery store.
What about me and Michael?
Are we... We are not.
That nightmare was being chased.
What's intercourse?
Is that like a car race?
Hill residents?
May I speak to Mr. Robert Hill?
This is he.
I am calling because I would like to ask you out on a date.
Yes!
May I ask who's calling?
It's done.
Ah, great.
Money first.
What the... Oh, they gave it to me and had a bite out of it, you know.
Ah.
Hmm.
