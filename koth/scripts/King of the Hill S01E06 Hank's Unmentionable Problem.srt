1
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:39,110
How was beauty school, Luanne?

2
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,953
Oh, how did the big shampooing final go?

3
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:50,383
Well, I passed the lather, but I failed rinse, and then I failed repeat, too, because it includes rinse, which I don't think is very fair.

4
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:57,031
Um, Hank, you forgot to flush.

5
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,132
Didn't have to.

6
00:00:58,452 --> 00:00:59,293
Didn't do anything.

7
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:00,455
Oh.

8
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:03,298
I see.

9
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,352
How long has this been going on?

10
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,857
There's nothing going on, Peg.

11
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:09,480
That's the problem.

12
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,524
Well, how long have you had this problem?

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:13,508
There is no problem, please.

14
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:15,873
This is not something we need to talk about.

15
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:20,322
Well, if you do have a problem, I could... Peggy, please, for God's sakes.

16
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,045
I'm getting a bite.

17
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:24,831
Is there any chicken fried steak left?

18
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:39,860
Here.

19
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:41,022
What's this?

20
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,263
It's megamucil.

21
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:46,429
I take 10 heaping teaspoons in a glass of water every night to stay regular like that.

22
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,491
I don't want to know that.

23
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,752
Oh, come on, honey.

24
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,136
Look, it is gentle and all-natural.

25
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,137
No, no, no.

26
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,179
Stop, please.

27
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:56,964
This is my own private, personal, private business.

28
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:58,145
At least drink the water.

29
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:01,991
If you drink enough water, it'll flush out your sister's teeth, please.

30
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,234
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

31
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,363
Hey, ancient sausage.

32
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:07,105
That looks good.

33
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:08,807
Peggy, where's my breakfast?

34
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:13,015
What are these?

35
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,439
I baked muffins.

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,861
So good for you.

37
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,023
Where's my sausage?

38
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,548
Well, we're out of sausage.

39
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:21,770
Hey, try a muffin.

40
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,791
They are oat brand.

41
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:24,855
Uh, sure.

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,132
You should eat those, Dad.

43
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,074
They help you make.

44
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:32,875
Excuse me?

45
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:32,975
Huh?

46
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,298
What are you implying?

47
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:37,521
Well, I thought you were constant.

48
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,163
Where would you get such an idea?

49
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:40,044
That's ridiculous.

50
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:43,548
Anyway, that's not something you should ever know about your father.

51
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,590
Well, it's pretty obvious.

52
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,813
You were in the bathroom for an hour last night.

53
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:48,714
No, I wasn't.

54
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,436
Okay, Dad.

55
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:51,778
Give me that.

56
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,525
What is it, Lady Bird?

57
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:00,335
You wanna go out again?

58
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:09,184
Show off.

59
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,106
Oh Nancy, I'm worried about Hank.

60
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:15,150
He hasn't done his business in four days.

61
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:19,114
Good lord, poor Hank.

62
00:03:19,134 --> 00:03:20,235
He looks so healthy.

63
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,358
But then, you know, so did Elvis Presley.

64
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,019
Nancy.

65
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,296
You don't think it's something serious?

66
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,884
Well, I'm a meteorologist, not a doctor.

67
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:34,495
But if I had to make an educated guess, I'd say he's got polio.

68
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:36,740
Oh, all right.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,083
I'm not a meteorologist.

70
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,105
I'm a weather girl.

71
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:42,824
So Hank, what's this I hear about you being backed up?

72
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:43,626
Nothing.

73
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:44,148
What?

74
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,694
Who are you thinking about talking to?

75
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:47,456
It's not me.

76
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:48,359
I'm fine.

77
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,063
Well, that's not what I heard.

78
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:51,326
Heard from who?

79
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:51,888
Dale.

80
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,472
How does Dale know?

81
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,234
Nancy.

82
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,520
Nancy knows too?

83
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:57,386
Who?

84
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:58,147
That Peggy.

85
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:02,151
Why not just take the door off the bathroom and put it out on the lawn?

86
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,314
Oh Hank, it happens to everyone now and then.

87
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,797
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

88
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:10,580
Maybe I'm not the one who should be embarrassed.

89
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,701
Did you ever think of that?

90
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:14,124
Maybe you're going a little too much.

91
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:18,468
Once every four or five days gives me more free time.

92
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,693
You want to spend all your time on the toilet, be my guest.

93
00:04:22,673 --> 00:04:24,115
Have you tried squatting?

94
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,459
It takes pressure off the lower body.

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,127
You know, Hank, I find a ride on the lawnmower helps.

96
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,691
Would you please stop talking about this?

97
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:34,893
Hey, Hank.

98
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:39,360
You know, I've been thinking about y'all and y'all dang old bottom and all what's gonna get moving again.

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,663
I think y'all ought to go jogging and swim in the water buns, man.

100
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:43,967
They're gonna be bad having you pooping just like you used to, man.

101
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,429
I know it's gonna work.

102
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,372
It helped my aunt after her pregnancy.

103
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,235
I don't know you, do I?

104
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:50,217
No, you don't.

105
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,007
Would you all please leave me be?

106
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,330
This is no one's business but my own.

107
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:03,861
Okay, but I've got one that's guaranteed to work for you Hank.

108
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:07,205
You take a spoonful of bacon grease.

109
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,947
I'm not eating bacon grease.

110
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:11,310
You didn't let me finish.

111
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:16,746
Simple chronic constipation can be a symptom of a more serious condition.

112
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:17,927
I should know.

113
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:21,110
I'm former Surgeon General C. Everett Coop.

114
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,435
Why did you have to go tell Nancy about my bathroom shortcomings?

115
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:30,339
Food that is not absorbed becomes waste and enters the pouch like sea cum.

116
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,962
Who the hell is that, Howard Stern?

117
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:38,547
Temperature is a pleasant 70 degrees and on a more personal note,

118
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,857
I want to wish my friend Hank Hill a quick recovery for his embarrassing constipation.

119
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,602
Oh, Peggy, why'd you do this to me?

120
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,844
Now everybody knows.

121
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,027
Oh, Hank, I was worried.

122
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,870
So worried to yourself?

123
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,653
Well, I'm tired of worrying to myself.

124
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,896
It's better to talk things out, Hank.

125
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,760
Not these things, not toilet things.

126
00:05:59,121 --> 00:05:59,782
All right, Hank.

127
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:05,070
All right, if it makes you this upset, I will just sit here silently alone with my worries.

128
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:06,272
Finally.

129
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:17,565
Uh, I'll have some skirt steak, some brisket, a little piece of that New York steak, uh, a couple of them steak fingers and a burger.

130
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,748
Oh, Hank, please.

131
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:19,790
Have just one veggie.

132
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,672
Oh, all right.

133
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:30,692
Uh, put some macaroni and cheese on there, too.

134
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:30,792
Mmm.

135
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:35,698
Ooh, chocolate sauce.

136
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:36,900
Can I have some?

137
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,161
No, uh-uh, Bobby.

138
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,903
This is an ordinary chocolate.

139
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,026
It is laxative for your father.

140
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:43,768
Oh.

141
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,293
Where'd you find this chocolate sauce, Peg?

142
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:48,134
It sure is good.

143
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:50,036
Here, Bobby, try some.

144
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,959
Okay, I thought you'd never ask.

145
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,143
Bobby, Bobby, uh, you know what that is.

146
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:56,685
So?

147
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:57,846
What is it?

148
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,428
Laxative.

149
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,500
You're trying to drug me?

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,023
Good God, that's going too far.

151
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,625
Well, you won't talk to me about it.

152
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,911
Now, what if it really is something serious, like polyps or worse?

153
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,413
You should see a doctor.

154
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,537
Stop making such a big deal out of it.

155
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,600
I just can't go to the bathroom.

156
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:30,478
Oh, my...

157
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,533
He looks like an angel.

158
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:40,119
A dead angel.

159
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,583
It should have been Bill.

160
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:48,948
Hank, we never got a chance to talk about your constipation.

161
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,171
And now, we never will.

162
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:54,314
Remember, early detection is the key.

163
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:57,057
Now pass in your algebra homework.

164
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,444
Goodbye, boy.

165
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:06,456
See you in hell!

166
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:15,586
Oh!

167
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:16,287
Occupied!

168
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:17,268
Hike!

169
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:18,570
You're alive!

170
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,192
Close the damn door!

171
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,834
Can't you see I'm in here, Peg?

172
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:23,676
No, don't touch me!

173
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,617
I'm on the John!

174
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,478
Get out of here!

175
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,560
Hike, I was so scared!

176
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,202
I dreamed you died!

177
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:30,704
You didn't see a doctor!

178
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,286
You didn't listen to Coop!

179
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,709
Peggy, you're not supposed to see this!

180
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,970
Listen, honey...

181
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,691
I love you.

182
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,173
Please don't die on me.

183
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,018
I love you too, but oh, jeez.

184
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:44,663
All right, I'll see a doctor if you just get out and leave me be.

185
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,646
You will?

186
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:47,968
Oh, Hank.

187
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,052
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

188
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:51,414
Yeah, well, come on.

189
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:52,255
Get a move on.

190
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,418
Oh, thank you.

191
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,199
Get!

192
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:04,033
And what exactly are you seeing Dr. Morley about today?

193
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:12,208
Uh, uh, well, I've been, uh, or, uh, actually, I haven't been... Sir, you're going to have to speak up.

194
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:22,744
I-I need to see him about a, uh, problem with, uh... Sir, just fill this out and have a seat.

195
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,630
Oh!

196
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,633
Bobby, put that down, you do not know where it's been, honey.

197
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,017
Come on, I'm trying to fill this thing out.

198
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,220
Hanky.

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,961
Mrs. McIntosh?

200
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:40,543
Hank Hill.

201
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:42,865
Is this your family?

202
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,588
I was your father's third grade teacher.

203
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:47,129
Oh?

204
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:48,870
Why are you here, Hanky?

205
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,553
This is an old person's doctor.

206
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:53,515
Well, Hank hasn't been able to take a... A walk.

207
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,518
I threw my knee out playing touch football.

208
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,159
Mr. Hill, I'm sorry, sir.

209
00:09:58,259 --> 00:09:59,200
I cannot read this.

210
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,041
What does it say?

211
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:00,501
Con?

212
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:01,542
Contact?

213
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:02,243
Contact?

214
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:03,064
Con what?

215
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:03,484
Uh...

216
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,233
So how are we doing today?

217
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:09,816
I'm Dr. Morley.

218
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:13,304
Let's see, so you're suffering from consumption?

219
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:14,427
Constipation.

220
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:16,371
Oh, constipation.

221
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,476
Well, that's quite a different matter.

222
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,523
How long has it been since your last bowel movement?

223
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:28,924
Well, uh, I usually don't keep track of that kind of thing, but... Five days, and Hank's usual schedule is ever two days.

224
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,227
Of course, when we were first married, he'd go every day.

225
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:35,630
But then I spoke to his mother, and she said the most interesting thing.

226
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,334
She said when he was a teenager, he would be in that bathroom three or four times a day... Maggie!

227
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:42,996
Please, Mr. Hill, this is helpful.

228
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:48,361
Now, your wife is obviously concerned, and if she's concerned, I'm concerned.

229
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,903
I think we'll do a sigmoidoscopy.

230
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,078
Say, honey, aren't you glad we're here?

231
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,240
Hi, Mr. Hill.

232
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,562
Why don't you go ahead and take off your pants for me, OK?

233
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:10,812
Why are you stopping?

234
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,295
Well, no sense in doing this now.

235
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,497
I'll just wait until the doctor comes back.

236
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:19,220
Sir, you're going to need to take your pants off for Dr. Morley.

237
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,763
OK.

238
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:29,594
Well, look at that, pig.

239
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,797
Cotton balls.

240
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,199
White ones.

241
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,844
Whole jar of them.

242
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:41,468
How many do you think there are in there?

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,791
I'll bet 30.

244
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,194
Yep.

245
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:49,797
30.

246
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:59,721
Okay, Mr. Hill, why don't you hop on the table and undo the back of your gown and we'll have a look at you.

247
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,903
You got all these fancy machines.

248
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:03,945
Can't you take a picture through the gown?

249
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,228
It's normal to be a little frightened, Mr. Hill.

250
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,330
Just turn your face to the wall.

251
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:10,833
Oh, you want me to get that?

252
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:11,434
No.

253
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:13,476
Mr. Hill?

254
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:14,797
Mr. Hill, this is Tasha.

255
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:15,818
She's a medical student.

256
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,681
Would it be all right with you if she observes the examination?

257
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,184
Uh, well, I guess.

258
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,678
We made it, honey.

259
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,501
Quick, 6-4, maternity.

260
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:46,366
Mr. Hill, this is a special camera that we use to get an inside view of your colon.

261
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,708
Just kill me now.

262
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,112
Mr. Hill, do you wish a bite plate?

263
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,015
Mom, I'm hungry.

264
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,825
Bobby, get outta here!

265
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:57,786
No, Mr. Hill.

266
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:01,373
When a family faces an illness, all members should be involved.

267
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,758
Remember, they're your get-well team.

268
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,040
Hey there, Ace.

269
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,483
Do you like video games?

270
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:07,245
Yeah.

271
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,830
Well, this joystick is just like a video game joystick.

272
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,154
Only my red button fires a real laser.

273
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,018
Cool.

274
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,204
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

275
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:17,344
Bobby.

276
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:18,711
Say, you're good.

277
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,314
Maybe you could help us out a little later.

278
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,117
Just kidding, Mr. Hill.

279
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,202
Mr. Hill, it doesn't hurt to smile.

280
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:27,925
It might actually help.

281
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:30,228
Tasha, you can begin.

282
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:35,797
So far, this looks normal.

283
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:36,778
Normal?

284
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,282
Uh, that's good, right?

285
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,602
Now, this is exciting.

286
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:44,707
There are so many twists and turns, I can't wait to see what's around the next bend.

287
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:47,870
The colon has to twist and turn because it's surprisingly long.

288
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:52,556
You know, Bobby, if I were to take your grandfather's intestine... I'm his father.

289
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:58,303
Your father's intestine and lay it out in a straight line, it would go all the way around the Earth.

290
00:13:58,744 --> 00:13:59,845
Wow.

291
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:00,266
Really?

292
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,129
Well, that is amazing, Doctor.

293
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,611
You know, I did not know that.

294
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,192
Now, how could that be?

295
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:09,417
The Earth is 25,000 miles around.

296
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:14,005
A piece of steak would have to shoot through your system faster than the speed of sound.

297
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:15,467
That's impossible.

298
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:19,894
Well, Mr. Hill, there's certainly nothing going through your intestines that fast.

299
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:22,098
Hey, I like this.

300
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,622
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?

301
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:30,531
Mr. Hill, I'm going to have to ask you to relax your buttocks for me, please.

302
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,154
How are you holding up, Mrs. Hill?

303
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:40,335
I'm okay.

304
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,939
I'm just a little uncomfortable from sitting here for so long.

305
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,463
Okay, let's take a five-minute break.

306
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,412
Well, Mr. Hill, we're not exactly sure what's causing your problem.

307
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,895
So at this point, the best option might be to remove something surgically.

308
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm sorry, but apparently your low-fat, high-fiber diet is not working.

309
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,900
Well, maybe Hank just needs to give his low-fat, high-fiber diet a little more time.

310
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,522
Isn't that right, Hank?

311
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:13,305
Yes, yes, all right.

312
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:17,372
Just to be safe, I'll book an operating room for the end of the week.

313
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:18,854
Oh, God.

314
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:19,435
Don't worry.

315
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:24,063
You know, it's possible to live a long, healthy, slightly less active life without a colon.

316
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,607
You just can't wear shorts.

317
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,419
Not dogs.

318
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,461
Now, what are these?

319
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,141
Hot dogs?

320
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:38,544
No, they're not dogs.

321
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,006
They're made of tofu.

322
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:40,927
Tofu?

323
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,129
I can't eat that crap.

324
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,971
Then try this fofu.

325
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:47,135
It's a tofu substitute for the tofu intolerant.

326
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:47,916
Mm-hmm.

327
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:50,059
Now, would that be good for a man who's constipated?

328
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:50,519
Peggy.

329
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,081
Well, I didn't say it was you.

330
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:53,743
Is this for your husband?

331
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:54,544
Yes.

332
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,687
And we will also take a quarter of your brown rice broth.

333
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,930
Do you have anything that tastes good?

334
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,393
Hmm.

335
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:01,673
Uh...

336
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:04,116
No.

337
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,418
Ooh, look at this, Uncle Hank.

338
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:11,605
Experience moxibustion with Mr. Lee, board-certified moxibustionist.

339
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,789
Relieves stress and opens the energy channels.

340
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,631
What the hell is that?

341
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,554
He sticks needles in your skin and sets them on fire.

342
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,257
Anyone ever try that on me, I'll kick his ass.

343
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,521
No, watch out behind you!

344
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:25,901
No!

345
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:27,183
Oh, God.

346
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,145
Gatorade all down his back.

347
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,114
Hank, it's two o'clock.

348
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:31,975
Bathroom time.

349
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,179
Peg, can I just... Bathroom time.

350
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,062
All right.

351
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:39,768
Hi there, Peggy.

352
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:43,934
We were wondering if Hank could come out and help us with my fence.

353
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:45,257
Oh, I'm sorry, Dale.

354
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:46,799
Hank is having his bathroom time.

355
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,066
Maybe later.

356
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:30,046
Well, thank you all for coming.

357
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:33,690
I thought it would help cheer Hank up to have all of his friends here.

358
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,053
I think he's making a lot of progress.

359
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:37,775
Well, where are you going, Hank?

360
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:38,556
To the bathroom.

361
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,719
Now just try to relax, Hank, and concentrate.

362
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,041
This could be it.

363
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:48,430
Peggy, please!

364
00:17:50,594 --> 00:18:04,000
Come on, Hank.

365
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:22,173
No, no, see what I'm saying is salad don't always have to have salad in it.

366
00:18:22,193 --> 00:18:24,136
See, there's potato salad in it.

367
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:25,397
Ooh.

368
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,922
I'm sorry, Peg, I let you down.

369
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:30,364
Let y'all down.

370
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:31,625
Don't you worry, Hank.

371
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:39,015
We still have 24 hours before your appointment, and we're gonna make the most of it.

372
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,141
You know, Hank seems a little down.

373
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,944
Well, he's a shell of a man.

374
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:14,749
I never thought Hank would have the willpower to give up everything he enjoyed in life.

375
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,991
Well, that's not Hank.

376
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:16,812
That's me.

377
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:22,000
I mean, if it was up to him, he'd still be eating burgers in the backyard with Dale, Bill, and BoomHour.

378
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,691
He'd still be drinking beer and shouting at the TV set and having a lot of fun.

379
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:36,720
Wait here.

380
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,491
So?

381
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,018
So what?

382
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:47,022
Well, I heard a... I mean, I wasn't listening, but I did hear a... Oh, that was my glasses.

383
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:50,601
Look, honey, we gotta talk.

384
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,407
I know you want to help, but this is getting out of control.

385
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,551
You can't treat a grown man like a baby.

386
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:58,693
It ain't right.

387
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:06,844
I feel like I've been trying to be someone else lately, eating food I don't eat, and I'm just not gonna do it anymore.

388
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:10,649
And if I don't ever poop again, well, that's just gonna be who I am.

389
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,816
I'd rather die with a burger in my colon than live and eat foe-foo.

390
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,460
Hank, I know and.

391
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:19,919
It's okay, you're right.

392
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:20,721
What?

393
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:26,272
Well, I'm only doing this because I want you to be around as long as possible because I love you.

394
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,378
But I have to let you be you.

395
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,943
Oh, thank you.

396
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,990
I'll still be here for a good long while.

397
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,671
I worry.

398
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:36,994
I know you do.

399
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:38,136
That you could.

400
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,741
I know, honey.

401
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:42,565
And I'm a lucky son of a gun, I tell you what.

402
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:48,032
To have a woman like you care so much about me, I'm gonna be more open.

403
00:20:48,552 --> 00:20:50,034
Tell you how I'm doing more.

404
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,676
And let you in.

405
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:55,822
I just want this moment to last forever, Hank.

406
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:56,623
Me too.

407
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,706
But it can't.

408
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,969
Oh, hold me, Hank.

409
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:02,210
No.

410
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:02,971
No.

411
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:03,972
Let go.

412
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:04,933
Let go.

413
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:16,813
Hmm.

414
00:21:40,402 --> 00:22:07,270
you might have noticed in tonight's episode there was some brief nudity now as an actor I only do nudity when I feel the script warrants it and I thought tonight's episode only warranted seeing the side of my rump you can believe me when I tell you the Fox executives were pushing for a whole lot more if any of you were offended by my body I'm truly sorry good night
