I found the coupons.
Oh, they've expired.
Dang it.
Oh heck, I'm really in the mood for some ice cream.
Let's just pay the full price.
Ah, you guys go on ahead without me.
I'm sticking to my New Year's resolution.
Ice cream once a day.
Not a boy, Bobby.
Nothing tastes sweeter than self-discipline.
That's right.
Go get your ice cream.
Lady Bird!
You ready, girl?
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby.
Oh, oh, yeah, labor.
Sorry, Peggy.
It's just that kid.
He stuck his fingers in the ice cream and it ruined the mood.
And we turn.
Bobby, what the hell are you doing with my dog?
It's extreme training.
Looked like dancing to me.
It was dancing.
It's called musical canine freestyle.
Liar.
No, no, no.
Look, it's a real thing.
They have contests and everything.
It started up in Canada.
They're supposed to be our allies.
Dad, it's okay.
The routine we worked out is low impact, and Lady Bird loves it.
She's 13 years old.
If I hadn't stopped you when I did, you could have displaced her hip.
But we were training for a contest in McManer Bear.
No.
No more dancing or any other Canadian tricks.
She's got arthritis.
Who's got arthritis?
Yes, you do.
Come on, girl.
Time for your nap.
I'll turn on the dryer to help you sleep.
Just when I think the boys act in normal, I catch him dancing with Lady Bird.
Ugh, and he had her wearing a bandana.
Dog's a bad man, best friend, man.
Tell them they don't care to dress him up like some of them dang old little lazy poodle, man.
Tell them they're a dang old dog, man.
They don't have dignity, man.
They don't have dignity.
Exactly, Boom Hauer.
Dancing with dogs, ridiculous.
Next thing you know, they'll have them smoking.
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Doggy cigarettes.
I thought of it first.
What kind of dance would he do, Hank?
I don't know.
The twist?
Why?
Bobby should be severely punished.
What was he thinking?
It's a jackass sport.
Excuse me, I have to attend a personal matter of pressing importance.
They're so busy these days.
I'm gonna miss dancing with that dog.
I know.
I dance with the seniors down at the nursing home.
Maybe that would cheer you up.
It would be nice to have a boy there for a change.
Have you been listening?
I wanna dance with dogs, not old people.
Jeez.
This new planer really does the trick, huh, Lady Bird?
Watch it, Lady Bird.
Daddy's using the planer.
What is it, Lady Bird?
You like that music, huh, girl?
Lady Bird, you're a beautiful dancer.
I'm looking to adopt a dog that could be a good dancing partner.
One that can really cut her up.
I was thinking maybe a long hair.
I like long hair.
That one there?
Well, he looked like he's strong and he's certainly got a lot of energy.
Are they a good breed for dog dancing?
Oh yeah, they're right.
Right for dancing.
I hope you like rock and roll.
So, you want to dance with my dog, but what's in it for the big dog?
Me?
A con?
Uh...
How about you pick up doggies poo from my yard?
That way, child prodigy Connie get to study more, poo picking here Billy get to dance with dog.
Universe in harmony.
He's a small dog.
How bad can it be?
Yeah.
Deal.
You start now.
Oh, jeez.
What are you feeding them?
Just going to get gas.
Hey Peggy, you notice anything different about Lady Bird?
Is the left side of her face paralyzed?
Nope, she's lost two pounds.
Typeworm, that was my second guess.
No, since I've been walking her more, she's been getting in great shape.
Listen, no creaking joints, and I've stopped giving her her anti-inflammatory medication.
Even her bark sounds more youthful.
It's like she's a puppy again.
You know, I'm gonna keep walking her.
I don't care what anybody thinks.
I love you, Peggy.
Hey Lady Bird, remember when you won this ribbon for cutest puppy at the mall?
Huh?
Do ya?
Labor Day?
Remember that, huh?
Do ya?
Fall of 89, huh?
Do ya, remember?
Yeah, me too.
Let's win you another ribbon, girl.
She's named after former First Lady Lady Bird Johnson.
So there is no limit to the number of sequins an entrant can have on his costume.
Can I get that in writing?
Mr. Hill, you forgot your pen.
Dad?
What are you doing here?
Okay, I know what this looks like, and it is what it is.
You lied!
You made me think dog dancing was for weirdos!
Wait a minute, that's Khan's dog.
You're dancing with the neighbor's dog against me and Lady Bird?
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Not dance with a dog?
And anyway, you said Lady Bird was too old to dance.
If you punked her full of pain pills, I'll make sure your bolt is qualified.
Well, what do you care?
Looks like you'll dance with any dog that'll have you.
Oh, he's not just any dog.
This little fella may poo like a buffalo, but he dances like Britney Spears.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think this pup's gonna surprise you with a few moves of her own.
I believe it's up to the judges to decide who's got the moves and who doesn't.
I'll see you out on the dance floor.
That's just a little taste, Dad.
Lady Bird.
Just let us in.
We'll go straight to my room.
We need to practice.
You're dancing with the neighbor's dog.
Go dance at the neighbor's.
Come on.
Leave or I'll call the pound.
You're scared, old man.
You're scared of my moves.
That's crazy.
Peggy.
Hank, this is all very simple.
You both want to dance with dogs.
Right.
You each have a dog you can dance with.
You take your dog to the garage.
You dance with her there.
Bobby gets to dance with his dog in his bedroom.
Everybody gets to dance with a dog.
Everybody wins.
You ready to dance Rex?
Of course you are.
It's in your blood.
You want to lead?
Is that it boy?
costume.
Now I know this isn't our style, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
Wow.
Lady Bird, I really think we're going to win this thing.
Oh, Bill?
Hey, I know you don't like dog dancing, but I need your advice.
I bought a dog to dance with.
It won't dance with me.
It's all my fault.
I'm doing something to push it away, just like I pushed away Lenore.
Bill, this isn't a good time.
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Oh.
Done, Lady Bird.
Look, keeping that hat.
Hank your dog dancing look you cannot tell Dale or boom how about this okay they wouldn't understand no of course they wouldn't their idiots oh isn't dog dancing wonderful Hank yes what am I doing to make the dog hate me Hank why why am I so repulsive you're not repulsive Bill maybe yes
Maybe it's the song you picked out.
The song is the song, the song.
What about the song?
Let your dog help choose the song.
Just don't let him pick something like doggy in the window or hound dog.
It's too obvious.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
You're not entering the competition, are you?
Well, yeah, I thought... Get out.
I get it.
This is good.
Nice and salty.
I said the funniest thing today.
Well, I almost did.
You gonna finish that, Gristle?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
But you never eat your Gristle.
You always give it to Lady Bird.
Spit it out.
You don't even like gristle.
But I do like the taste of you not getting it.
Mike!
Bobby, stop it!
No ribbon is more important than your family.
For God's sake, you are fighting over fat!
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Uh, let me make it up to both of you, Peggy.
Let's go out dancing like we usually do and let Bobby and Doggy have the house to practice.
Alone.
But you have to lock Lady Bird in the garage.
Of course.
Oh, it is certainly nice to get out of the house.
It's been so tense with all the arguing and barking.
I'm glad you're having fun, because you deserve it.
Oh, Hank, you are dip crazy tonight.
Yep, yep.
So, uh, since you brought it up, do you know if Bobby does any dips in his routine or any other moves you've noticed?
Are you pumping me for information?
How much backwards walking are they doing?
A little?
Average?
Or a lot?
Hank, I am trying really hard to remain neutral here.
I thought you wanted to dance with me.
I do.
I do.
You're right.
It's just you and me, Lady Bird.
What?
You just blew it, mister.
Fine.
You know what?
I hope Bobby wins.
What?
Oh, sure.
Go home to Bobby and the neighbor's dog.
While you're at it, why don't you just move in with Con and Min?
You can eat rice all day and never celebrate Christmas.
Good luck, Hank.
It's got nothing to do with luck, Peggy.
We're gonna win this thing.
You're making a big mistake.
Lady Bird hates you.
What do they see in that yappy little rat?
We can win this thing without him, right, Lady Bird?
You look great in that outfit, by the way.
On the count of three, everyone say bones.
One, two.
Don't move it, just a red eye.
Bones!
Wow, these dogs are dressed to the nines.
It's like they're going to dance at the White House.
Don't worry, Lady Bird.
We're going to win this thing.
Remember, it's not just about pageantry.
It's about a man and his dog dancing together.
That's what the people came to see, and that's what we're going to give them.
It's our Trump card.
That's what we've got over all these nut jobs.
Right, girl?
Come on, Rich.
Sit down.
We're going to be late for the competition.
Yeah!
Let's have another big round of applause for Pam Taylor and her Irish setter, Sparkles.
more like fizzles.
Still leaving the dance area.
I'm Doug Jefferson along with sketch Randall and we're just so gushed on happy to be here.
And they're off the dance floor.
Next up is Hank Hill and his purebred bloodhound Lady Bird.
Are you ready to see more dancing?
Okay pup, this is it.
Uh, I just wanted to, uh, apologize for what Lady Bird and I are about to do.
When?
I go out walking After midnight Out in the moonlight
Well, hello to you two, Hank Hill.
And what poison nobility from that bloodhound?
The feet, the hand, the tail.
All moving as one unit.
No wonder this proud bitch was named after our former first lady.
Oh!
Bill Dothriev and Rex, you're on deck.
And no muzzles.
Yeah, but I- No muzzles.
Those are the rules.
No.
Time to go, girl.
It's not too late for you and Doggie to turn tail.
Take some notes, because this is how people are going to be dog-dancing from now on.
Next up, Bobby Hill and his mixed terrier, Doggie.
We are witnessing a dream.
I hope I never wake up and this dance lasts forever.
A boy, a dog, a dance.
Are they even touching the floor?
Amazing.
Boy, the alley's dead today.
I don't even know how to describe that move.
I wish everyone who denies the pure athleticism of dog dancing could see what I'm seeing right now.
Okay, Lady Bird.
All flash, no substance.
And the third prize for beginner's off-leash musical freestyle goes to Rhonda Clark and her border collie, Rusty.
Second prize goes to Bobby Hill and his neighbors dog doggy And first prize goes to this is it girl Helen Bradley and her toy poodle
Well, we did our best, girl.
It's a young dog sport.
Come on, let's go home.
It's time for your nap.
You wanna watch me paint, girl?
It's semi-gloss.
No, Lady Bird, that's not for us.
How can I say no to that face?
Care to cut in, son?
There's someone else I owe this dance to.
Ma'am?
Now where were we?
the midnight search
Move your paw!
