Okay, Dale, hop on up.
I don't know.
Looks like he died with his tongue sticking out.
Let me try again.
I can look deader.
No way, man.
Deader's dead, man.
He's getting old.
I'm sitting up there.
He'd harness it into a dang old wedgie city up here, man.
Well, it's a small price to pay, Boomhauer.
I'm the general contractor of the school's haunted house, and it's my responsibility to bring this job in on time, under budget, and over scary.
You know it's a damnedest thing.
I got myself a wedgie, too.
Hank, dinner time.
I am stirring in the cheese powder.
Okay.
Hey, peg leg, can you come out here and give me a hand?
What is it, honey?
I'm right in the middle.
Gotcha!
Oh, you?
Oh, that just took a year off of my life, I think.
I'm gonna scare the pants off those kids, I tell you what.
I want Bobby to have the perfect Halloween.
The kind I had when I was a boy.
Trick-or-treat!
Oh my, aren't you boys the scariest?
Yeah, man, talk about... WAH-HA-HA-HA-HA!
Dang old boo, man.
You got any candy cigarettes?
No, but I have chocolate.
Happy Halloween!
Only one.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on, push it over, knock it down quick!
Okay, Dale's house is next.
I think I'll go call my mom.
Want to come with us?
Megalomart is running a Halloween special.
If you buy two rubber masks, they will punch out the nostril holes for free.
Oh, sorry.
I gotta go to my youth fellowship meeting.
We're going to deliver a hot meal to old people and then blow on it.
Maybe I could be a Dalmatian.
Halloween costumes are supposed to be scary.
How's a Dalmatian scary?
They can bite you.
And nine times out of ten, they go right for the growing.
Where are the vampires and monsters and ghosts?
Elmo, Aladdin, Jenny McCarthy?
I don't even know what these things are.
I'd like to introduce our guest speaker.
She's a new member of our church who has made herself known in a very short time through a series of gutsy letters, complaints, and threats.
Miss Junie Harper.
Thank you.
Why don't we just start things off with a little quiz?
I hope it's open Bible.
Who can tell me what this is?
It's a witch.
Very good.
What's your name?
Luann Flatter.
Luann.
You answered that so fast.
Do you know any witches yourself?
Witches aren't real.
Yes, they are.
But they even have their own holiday.
Who knows what October holiday is associated with witches, goblins, and Satanists?
Um, Halloween?
Smart.
Smart, smart.
Oh, this girl is very, very smart.
Thank you for noticing.
Well, we still need a costume for Bobby, but at least we got our treats.
Eat wells, sugar-free, low-fat, fun bars.
Thank you, that stuff isn't for trick or treaters.
It's for diabetics.
Well, I'm not going to gain 10 pounds like I did last year.
So don't eat it.
Just leave it there.
No one said you could touch my candy anyway.
The ancient druids celebrated Halloween by eating babies by the light of their jack-o'-lanterns.
And then they danced.
Boy, I'm sure glad your grandma kept my old costume.
You know, I used to have a laugh that went along with this.
Try it with me, son.
Scary.
Ah, it was disturbing.
I can't get it, Peggy.
I have terrible news.
Halloween is a satanic holiday.
It was invented by the Druish.
No, honey.
Not Druish.
The Druids.
Where did you hear that garbage?
It's the truth.
Took a cheating.
It's devil worship.
Junior half percent so.
Luan, Halloween is just good, clean fun.
It's got nothing to do with the devil.
Now I don't want to hear any more of your foolishness.
Oh.
Well, what is wrong with you?
She just put some exciting new thing in her braid and all she wanted to do was show it to us.
My pretty kitty.
So you told him about the druids and the candy corn and he still thinks Halloween is just for fun.
Uh-huh.
I felt so stupid.
Oh, no.
First of all, in the eyes of the Lord, you're a genius.
The devil likes to fool you into thinking you're stupid because it makes it easier for him to trick you.
But if you think you're smart, you can resist him.
Do you see what I'm saying?
I'm not sure.
Satan be gone!
Now you see?
Yes.
These days Satan's getting very popular.
That's why this Halloween I'm sponsoring a hallelujah house.
Oh, what's that?
It's a righteous alternative to those wicked haunted houses.
Oh no!
Uncle Hank is running a haunted house down at Bobby's school.
The school?
Tell me more.
Let's get the rise and run of this trough, right?
I don't want my blood rushing to my severed head.
Hey, Principal Moss.
Hello, Hank.
Mr. Gribble, this is a school.
You got to take that cigarette outside.
Yes, sir.
Jackass says what?
What?
Hank, you know Mrs. Ginny Harper.
She has some concerns.
Apparently some people consider Halloween a religious holiday.
So?
So our Constitution guarantees a separation of church and state.
Ms.
Harvard has a point.
And an attorney.
What's the skeleton for?
Planning to read fortunes with the casting of bones?
No.
And what's that?
A witch?
That has got to go.
I'm not taking out any of this stuff.
I want those kids to have a real scary Halloween.
You know, I'm starting to feel like the whole idea of a house of horrors is wrong.
Oh, we can make it a house pancakes.
I'm just brainstorming here.
Shut up, Bill.
Look, we either do this haunted house the right way, or I'm not doing it at all.
Now, what's it gonna be?
Hank, we can't afford another lawsuit.
We blew our budget fighting wheelchair ramps and left-handed scissors.
So that's how it is, huh?
Boomhauer, grab Hagatha.
There's only room for one witch in here.
Well, I don't know.
It's your do-love, Pentax.
Next year, Bobby's gonna be a teenager.
It's our last Halloween together, and Junie Harper ruined it.
You know, there's nothing in the Constitution about separation of church and garage.
Why don't you make a haunted garage?
Yeah, I guess I could do that.
Not ah, Uncle Hank.
You could go to hell.
See, Junie Harper says a haunted house is the devil's mousetrap, and fun is the cheese.
Luanne, just when I think you've said the stupidest thing ever, you keep talking.
Junie says I'm smart, so don't try and trick me into thinking I'm not.
Now, hold on.
Luan is not stupid, and neither is Hank's idea for a haunted house.
So, you can have your haunted garage, and you can be smart.
But Junie Harper says... Junie Harper says, Junie Harper says, last time I checked, it wasn't Junie Harper's face in the stained glass window at Arlen First Methodist.
Bobby, next Halloween, you're going to be too old to dress up and get candy.
What?
Now, don't panic.
Treats are only half of trick-or-treat.
It's time you learn to give as well as receive.
You're not going to throw that, are you?
Bobby, of course I am.
It's a sign of respect.
Hey, you know who could use little respect right now?
Dale.
Josh, what?
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
Josh, what?
Josh, what?
You know, I'm suddenly reminded of a Bible quote.
Do unto others.
I don't know, Dad.
This is vandalism, and vandalism isn't cool.
Bobby, that attitude is a little immature.
Now come on.
The God I have backspin, son.
Like this.
I am not afraid of you Satanists!
Come on boy!
I'm not afraid, I won't be afraid.
I'll stand up to all of you!
It's the fuzz!
Quick!
Ditch the evidence!
Well, there must be some mistake.
My Bobby?
Son, did you pay Mrs Harper a little visit tonight?
Yes.
Bobby!
Now, don't jump all over the boy.
The truth is, this is my fault.
Well, of course it is.
His antisocial behavior is the result of your whole family's anti-Christian values.
You hold it right there, Judy Harper.
You are out of order.
I go to church, too, and I have raffled and bing-o'd and bake-selved my way as close to the good Lord as you.
So do not try to one-up me, because I will one-up yours.
The complacency of fools will destroy them, Proverbs.
Get out of my house, Exodus.
You're a regular Halloween hellraiser, just like your old man.
And I'm very disappointed in you.
I'll never use toilet paper and anger again.
Are you alright?
I didn't hear the TV on.
I grounded myself.
I don't deserve to watch TV after what I did last night.
It's not your fault.
It's Uncle Hank's fault.
He's a Satanist, Bobby.
Oh, come on, Luan.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
It's true.
Oh, dang.
That's why Uncle Hank snatched my ideas about Halloween.
The devil doesn't want you to know the truth.
Did your father ever make you drink blood?
He made me live her once.
That is called a recovered memory.
Think, Bobby.
What else can you remember?
Where are the vampires and monsters and ghosts?
You're a regular Halloween hellraiser, just like your old man.
It's just liver.
It's not gonna kill you.
The vandalism upon my house can only be described as a hate crime.
Somebody hates me.
Let the record show that somebody hates Dale Gribble.
Last night, my house was also attacked by Satanists.
Ms.
Harper, what evidence do you have of that?
What evidence?
How is this for evidence?
Little kitty!
Well, I think it is perfect, although I still think Hank Hack works just as well.
Yes!
Halloween is cancelled!
I just got off the phone with Mrs. Juni Hafer and she said that the city council passed a curfew because a satanist made her run over her cat.
What about the trick-or-treaters?
Oh, there won't be any trick-or-treaters.
See, Uncle Hank, you said I was wrong, but now everyone agrees with me.
Nobody agrees with you.
You agree with everybody else.
You agree with any idiot who says anything.
Stop attacking her, Hank.
Luanne didn't cancel Halloween.
Judy Harper did.
Well, I don't care what she does.
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna teach Bobby the true meaning of Halloween, come hell or high water.
My dad sure wants me to be at that haunted house.
The last time he wanted me to be somewhere so bad, I woke up without tonsils.
Well, this time he may be after yourself.
I'm scared, Luanne.
I can't help you, Bobby, but I know who can.
Mrs. June Harper.
Thanks for helping me get away.
I heard Satanists like my dad always sacrifice virgins, so we both better be careful.
Where is everybody?
I can't believe they're staying home because of a curfew.
And where the heck is Bobby?
He's still out with Luanne.
I sent them to the store for more high sea.
Now I guess that was a fool, Erin.
Isn't there one person in this town with the courage to celebrate Halloween?
Heck, while you're out there, turn off my hose.
First of all, I'd like to say hello to everybody.
Now, follow me, children.
No pushing.
He who is last shall be first.
Oh, what have we here?
It's a young, unmarried couple who are about to let their hormones get the best of them.
Oh, I guess the old saying is true.
Sex kills.
Dinner's ready.
Where's grandpa?
Oh, that's your grandpa?
Haven't you heard?
Our ancestors are monkeys.
Oh no, he's eating the baby.
Stop him, honey.
We can't.
It's against the law to teach creationism.
Have you seen Bobby?
I think he said he was going to the gym.
Luanne.
All right, I took him to Junie Hoppers.
He's a lot better off there.
What are you
Well, I think that it's better for a child to receive wholesome impressions from established religious authorities than participate in rituals that are conducted by people who really don't even know that they are pawns of the devil.
Whoa, little missy, you hold it right there.
I've headed up to here with your baloney.
I have taken you into my home.
I have sheltered and fed you.
But if you step between my husband and his son, I will cast you out like yesterday's garbage.
From now on, you lead the parenting to us.
We get a magazine about it.
I brought you a nice cold beer.
Thanks, Peggy.
Uh, Louie took Bobby to Junie Harper's house for an anti-Halloween church party.
I came very close to spitting out beer.
I knew you'd be upset.
They wrecked my haunted house, they outlawed my trick-or-treating, and now they want to brainwash my boy?
It's time for somebody to do something.
Hank, no!
You could go to jail!
I knew the risks when I put on the uniform.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Trick or treat.
Hey man, check it out, man.
I need no dang on costume.
Man, I need to put on a bit of dang on mine, man.
Look at this, I'm trying to get out of this box, man.
See, whoa, man, don't play tug of war, man.
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Here comes the ghost!
Don't go!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Boo!
I am a high-priced Washington lobbyist peddling influence.
Who wants candy?
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Come on, Lou Anne!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
Okay, Susie, what's it gonna take to get you to join the Hallelujah Club tonight?
Look, you took the brownie.
I didn't make you take the brownie.
Congratulations, Bobby.
Hey, everybody, listen up!
Bobby Hill has joined the Hallelujah Club.
Hallelujah, Bobby!
Can I have another brownie?
I'll handle this.
Trick or treat!
Hey, Bobby.
Go away, Satan.
Bobby, it's just a costume.
There is a curfew in effect, Mr. Hill.
But I guess you have no respect for man's law, either.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
Come on, son, let's go trick or treating.
He will not, because he is a good boy.
Hmm.
All right, Bobby.
I don't want to force you to choose.
I just wanted to spend Halloween with my son, but I guess I can't do that this year.
It just tears my heart out.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm just keeping an eye out for my son.
Oh, Mercy, what have I done?
Do not encourage this monster.
This is vile.
Come on, Bobby.
Halloween's just no fun without you.
Bobby, if you leave now, you'll never get the key to the kingdom.
Come on, son.
Let's get some candy.
You'll go to hell!
You'll get candy.
Hell!
Candy!
Candy!
Stop!
I don't care about candy.
I just want to be with my dad.
All right, then.
Fine!
Go on, all of you!
More room in heaven for me!
We gotta get you home and scare you up a costume.
Okay.
Hey, Dad.
I was just kidding before.
I care about candy.
I care a lot.
Happy Halloween, everyone!
Oh, my God, Dad.
Dang old boo, man, yo.
