Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Dale, what the heck are you?
Oh, I see you've noticed the land canoe.
It's an old motorcycle-side car I found, now cunningly stabilized with a bicycle wheel and propelled by this golf club.
Dale, that is the stupidest gut thing... I want to ride in the land canoe!
Sorry, Bill, this is a one-man land canoe.
Away!
Huh.
It goes faster than I expected.
I love how they spell words in the Economist.
It's like you can see the classy British accent.
Hank, I can't stop!
I can't!
Oh, yeah!
My rules is, some hot concoil's been wrong.
Stupid hillbillies.
If we were members of Nine Rivers Country Club, we couldn't skip this.
But Nine Rivers got that four-strikes-your-out application policy, and we are on our last strike.
We need to wait for our perfect opportunity.
Bobby, listen!
Lucky can make his truck engine play green eggos.
I'm in.
We do whatever it takes.
No, look at our little garbage boy.
He is growing into a garbage man.
Completing a scheduled chore in a timely fashion.
Wait, why is he leaving the bags on the curb?
Into the cans, Bobby.
Step three, like we talked about.
Step three.
I'm going out there.
It was already full.
Is this even our garbage?
It smells too old to be ours.
We don't use canned milk or drink old granddad.
It is someone else's good lord.
I feel so...
Violated, a stranger from another block used my cans.
What makes you so sure the guy isn't from our block?
He threw away a car battery.
I do not live on the same block with animals.
Thank you, Hank.
Our key to success is to excel at something that Nine Rivers needs.
They're the best, and they will take you if you're the best.
What are we the best at?
Discover a hidden realm of luxury a realm of luxury We offer many activities where excellence is encouraged or in most cases required archery Calligraphy, Khan.
How's your calligraphy?
Unexceptional Polo competitive skeet shooting team and new media labs
Hey, that's it.
Skeet shooting.
Back in Laos, you were an excellent shot.
I was young, beautiful girl with lots of rage back then.
Wait, I still filled with rage, and I'm still pretty hot.
Give me a gun.
Our ski team made the tri-club classic this year and we are thrilled to bit.
Frankly, our scruffy little gang might even beat the high and mighty Pennington Oaks.
Wouldn't that be a thing?
That's why I'm here!
Name a target!
I guarantee I nail it!
Uh, Min?
Ski involves shotguns and moving targets.
But if you do master the sport, call me.
Or maybe texting would be better.
Stupid real estate development.
That's the third gun range I call that's closed to make room for new condos.
Wait, they all Gribble got a private gun club, remember?
Shoot with Gribble?
You nuts!
We're trying to escape here, Billy.
It's not climbing to bunk bed with them.
I mean, I want to show you something.
They call this Board Whiffle Bear.
I got it!
Mine, mine, mine!
To escape from Rednecks, I joined the club.
Here, neighbor.
Let me help you.
Man, I can't believe you wanted to join our gun club.
See, I always thought you hated me.
Don't be a silly goose.
Why would you think I hated you?
Well, you always talk about how you hate my son and how you hate my friends.
How much you hate me.
Ah, cultural misunderstanding.
This place takes me back to the days of shooting with my dad's original, non-modified AK-47.
You shot an old-school AK?
Put her there.
I'm fancy, this is the most.
Wait.
Excuse me.
Great to meet you.
You guys call me Johnny Knucklehead, because I ain't too bright.
Um, okay, knucklehead.
So, how about we shoot some guns?
That sounds good.
Yeah, okay.
I'm easy.
All right!
You see that?
Wow.
Men is my neighbor.
So, how did practice go?
Did it go great?
Is your shooting improving?
Shooting was fine, but the place are pigsty.
They don't even have a skeet range.
Those rednecks are just bears with furniture.
Hey, those bears are our ticket to Nine Rivers.
So smile and be nice to them.
We must stay focused on our reward.
Hello, Conn, and Mid.
Hello, Ted.
It's Sydney.
Are you enjoying your membership here at Night Rivers?
Oh, yes, we are, Ted.
Super.
Oh, you paint such a vivid picture.
Men, codename Madamex.
As a new member, we have come to kidnap you for your secret club initiation.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Uh, no thanks.
Bye!
Don't be ridiculous.
Mingo, I was your great new friend!
Live life!
Have fun!
Eat lots of mayonnaise!
Now Bobby, fitting two weeks worth of garbage into one week's cans, takes some clever bag positioning.
But it's a valuable life skill.
Dang it!
Dang it!
Dang it!
Who are you?
Why me?
Oh, Hank, not again.
Dad, I saw a dumpster four blocks over.
We could sneak over there when it gets dark.
No, I refuse to spread this disease.
Tomorrow I'm fixing padlocks on our cans.
There's the man I married.
Sergeant at arms, perform your duty.
Brother Min, do you solemnly swear to be loyal to your brother members?
Um, yes, I do.
Now the secret password will be revealed.
How like a werewolf.
What?
Woo-woo-woo!
Like that.
Um, uh, woo?
Come on with feeling.
Try again.
Woo!
Well, that's it.
You're one of us.
Boy, Min is a breath of fresh air.
She's like a spiky-haired new wave rocker, giving a jolt of raw energy to the bloated arena band that was once our gun club.
Yesterday, my doctor told me... Min is the coolest!
She beat me at Stratigo, and she can belt just like a dude.
It all sounds so glamorous.
Sounds like men's out of ammo.
Are you gonna keep it?
No, no, me, I'll get it.
Hey, guys.
I'm in.
So, you guys ever think about building a skeet shooting range?
No.
Is that what you want us to think about?
I just asked because there's this contest I thought we could enter.
The Tri-Club Skeet Classic.
That's why we admire you men.
You're always dreaming up new things to shoot.
Count us in.
He picked the locks.
Who is this monster?
Yeah, I don't see garbage.
I see a bag of clues.
I'm going in.
So, we are trapped with here, Billy's?
They're eating out of my hand.
I even got them building a skit range.
Ah, perfect!
By the way, why are you cleaning so many guns?
Oh, these are fitzies.
He always forgets to lube the upper side of the trigger.
And you should have seen Moose today.
He fell down in the grass and when he got up, he had leaves all stuck in his beard.
It was so cute.
Mean?
Don't go native on me.
Me?
No.
Relax.
You know, some of the things Gribble says about JFK and Oswald sound crazy at first, but if you really follow the money...
That's six perfect sets in a row.
We got a deal or not.
Man, Cod, welcome to Died Rivers.
Lead us to victory against those snobs at Pennington Oaks.
Yes!
Congratulations, Cod.
By the way, there's a refresher course in Club Etiquette that you'll be taking.
Mean, my love, tonight the first night of the rest of our lives.
I'm making farewell to Redneck's video.
I'm going to tell each individual hillbilly to go to hell, in my own words.
Want to do Peggy Hill?
I don't know.
Come on, it's fun.
Dear Redneck Ogress.
Men, we had matching t-shirts made for the shooting contest.
Don't worry, I already washed yours.
I know how much you're afraid of pink eye.
Oh, that's sweet.
But see... And look, we changed your code name to President Men because we elected you president.
Yep, I resigned just for you.
Uh, guys, look, I just got asked to shoot for Nine Rivers Geek Team, so I'm gonna be over there from now on.
Wait, so are you going to shoot for them and us?
I'm not sure I understand.
No, only them.
Oh, guys, it's complicated.
You took an oath to be loyal to your fellow members.
Well, I only swore on a beer can.
Yeah, so I guess that means it never counted.
Come on, guys.
Okay, great.
You already handled Gribble.
Now come on back inside so we can do Bobby Hill.
You must eat.
You need energy for big winning day.
I don't deserve to eat or to win.
Don't be upset about rednecks.
They like earthworms.
Barely have nervous system.
They don't really feel pain.
They trusted me and I betrayed them.
Hilarious!
They would don't be here, Billy, to trust you and then you cleverly betrayed them.
Think she's better than us?
I'll show her.
We'll see about you, men.
Pull!
Now I'm not finished!
Load it again!
We're kidding.
She is better than us.
In fact, yes.
Yet I still feel the need to take revenge.
But how?
Wait a minute.
We've got guns!
We can break into their snooty club and wreck their snooty contest!
Rack it?
With what?
With our guns!
Another empty jelly jar filled with used Q-tips.
This is not worth it.
Well, justice isn't always pleasant.
Well, it's not hard data, but at least we can assemble a profile.
Our perp is a dirty man with clean ears.
As you can see, we've expanded.
We were finally able to take over the Deaf Children's Academy next door.
They put up quite a fight.
Oh, the beauty stopped my heart.
How are your spirits, men?
You do realize we're counting on you today?
Yeah, I know.
Where's gun range?
Well, it's not on this side, or it would scare the koi.
To that side!
As first-time hosts of this event, we are proud to welcome the reigning ski champions, Club Pennington Oaks.
In the spirit of friendly rivalry, allow me to say Pennington Oaks, today you are going down.
Pardon me.
Now let's do it.
Let's shoot.
Good heavens, it's Atlantis!
They got music under the water!
You there!
Can I help you?
No thanks, we're doing fine.
Uh-oh.
Run!
You're gunning ten for ten.
Spectacular.
Ace this round and we're home free.
On your count.
Nyaaah!
Ribble, why the hell you come here?
At first, revenge.
But now we're too impressed by the luxury to stay mad at you.
That pulls like 80 degrees.
And did you see they have a tortoise walking around?
Hand over your weapons!
What is the meaning of this?
Mid, do you know these people?
Uh...
Yeah, I'm the president.
Whatever that means, I still want them ejected and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Oh wait!
They're my guests!
I used all my guest passes so my friends could cheer me on today.
They must have gotten lost.
Right, guys?
Me?
You crazy?
You gonna blow all our guest passes?
How am I supposed to impress my work superiors?
I got us in here, Khan.
So it's my call.
Take it or leave it.
Your guest pass privileges will certainly be under review.
But now, men, you're up.
Oh, right.
Pull!
Match, nine rivers.
Yeah!
Okay, with that fingernail, we now know that the culprit has at least eight fingers.
Aunt Peggy, are we having an indoor yard sale?
Look, baby girl, my spare keys.
I must have tossed them by mistake.
Lucky, is this your trash?
Sure is.
Government wants to charge me a garbage tax.
Hell no, don't tread on me, I say.
I figured since we're family you'd want to help.
Lucky, I demand that you stop putting your garbage in my cans.
Nothing like seeing your garbage laid out to make you realize how fortunate you are.
To live in a country where you can eat Chinese chicken salad one day and baklava the next.
If I got to pay a little extra to get rid of my refuse, so be it.
God bless America.
That was beautiful, Lucky.
This Baytac Blue is an explosion of sophisticated flavors.
And this 97 P.D.O.
has its own story.
It's the au pair who slaps you after you chase her into the kitchen.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I really taste that.
Hello?
Min, you won't believe what happened just now.
That whole looking-before-you-shoot thing you taught us really does work.
Me and Moose just hit two drops in only eight shots.
Amazing!
Put Moose on.
Moose!
Talk later!
Sorry.
Bit of private business.
You did it!
You don't know what I want to tell him.
