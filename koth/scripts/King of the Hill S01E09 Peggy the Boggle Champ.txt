Now, men, the game of boggle is really quite simple.
The goal is to make words out of these 25 letter cubes.
Bami tam yum.
It's got to be a real word, honey.
Yes, bami tam yum.
Thai spicy noodle soup.
Tasty and delicious.
I tell you, I hate to see Nancy cooped up all Sunday playing that boggle.
It's a beautiful day.
She ought to be outside, hanging my laundry.
Sunday, Sunday, and Saturday.
It's the Nathaniel Dallas Moer Expo.
Be there as the biggest names and moors, headers and clippers, unveil the latest in grass cutting technology.
Thrilled to the awe-inspiring spectacle of the snapper precision mowing team.
Sea King mulch, tick on a Texas sized pile of quakes.
Over 10,000 oil paintings must be sold.
Don't miss the Dallas Moer Expo.
Be there!
Pad Thai doesn't count, Min.
I guess I win again.
Boy, Aunt Peg, the words I don't know could fill a dictionary.
You know, the Elks are having a boggle tournament to raise bail money for their treasurer.
Maybe you should enter.
Me?
Oh, fish.
I just play for fun.
Min, you owe me $13.
Thank you for boggle lesson, Piggy.
Maybe next week I teach you my young.
Bring your checkbook.
Hi, Hank.
I'm thinking of entering a boggle tournament over at the Elks.
Boggle?
Boy, the Elks will do anything for a dollar.
Are they still playing that game where the cows gotta drop dung in a square?
Boggle is nothing like Cowbingo, Hank.
Boggle is a game of wits.
Now, Cowbingo is a game of strategy.
Oh, yeah!
All right, Piggy, I replaced my watch battery, ate a Cinnabon, and bought a P-trap.
I can't kill any more time.
Let's go.
Shank.
It is only round five.
Hmm.
Impatient.
Okay, that's time.
Pencil's down.
Let's tote them up.
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but I only used words that appear in Patsy Klein lyrics.
Oh, little sick boy.
Would you like for me to find your name in the next boggle?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Oh, yeah!
Boy, that life of yours is pretty good.
I guess that's why they call her your better half.
Who calls her that?
They.
And I hope that your leg gets better real soon, Zachary Quinn Jr.
Oh my goodness, congratulations!
You won, Mom!
Looks like someone's gonna have to clear some room on his trophy shelf.
Easy, Peggy, that's my MVP trophy.
Mom's trophy's bigger than yours.
Oh, Poo, I don't care about the trophy.
The real honor is getting to represent Arlen in the state boggle championship.
You're going to state?
Oh, that's so exciting.
Just like when Uncle Hank made the state for high school football.
Oh, yeah, it's exactly like that, Luanne.
Oh, well, it might not be football, but there are over 200 competitors, and you're allowed to bring a coach.
Hi, you want to be my coach?
A boggle coach?
What would I do?
Well, Hank, you don't have to do anything.
You just have to be there.
Unless you want me to go off to Dallas by myself.
Dallas?
I don't want you going to Dallas at all.
That place is crawling with crackheads and debutants.
And half of them play for the cowboys.
Oh, come on, Hank.
It's just for the weekend.
We'll be back on Sunday.
Sunday!
Sunday!
Sunday!
Guess who's going to the mower show?
And if you guess right, you can come with me.
It's you.
Right?
Did I win?
Yep.
Am I going?
Boy, how'd you manage to swing that with Peggy?
She don't like mowers like we like mowers.
Simple.
I found a boggle tournament in Dallas to keep her busy while we have some real fun.
Check it out, man.
Talk about a road trip up at that big demotel, man.
He doesn't talk about the biggest names in mowers, edges, and clippers.
Be there!
Man, it's gonna be fun.
Let's go, Peggy.
We gotta get to Dallas before the gangs wake up.
Hank!
Shh!
It's 4 AM!
Can I go back to bed, Aunt Peggy?
I need to get eight hours of beauty sleep and then write a paper on it.
In a minute, honey.
Now, it is very important that we know we can trust you two.
Now, no parties while we're gone.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
On behalf of the Arlenboggleboosters,
I'd like to present you with this jacket.
Good luck, Peggy.
W-I-M.
I promised to make Dara King, Mr. Lube, and Rivera Sump pumps proud.
This weekend, Peggy Hill is going to put Arlen Texas on the map.
OK, Peggy Hill.
Good luck, and maybe goodbye.
Maybe?
Well, I come from either you come home a winner or you not come home at all.
Good luck, Peggy Hill.
Are you watching?
Risky business?
Who and?
That movie's got bad words in adult situations.
Not anymore.
I rented it at Blockbuster.
I also got a fire safety video starring Chuck Mangione.
Wanna watch?
No thanks.
I've got it in the middle of doing laundry.
Okay.
But remember, Chuck says always unplug your iron after use.
Thanks for the tip.
It's okay, honey.
Ballet parking is included in the price of the room.
I don't like the looks of this one, Peggy.
He's just itching to take my truck for a joy ride.
Hi.
It's lovely.
Look at that.
Oh, look, everyone.
It's Peggy Hill, Bagel Champ of Ireland, Texas.
I'm Joan, Bagel Hospitality Coordinator.
Here's your tournament told back, a schedule of events at a bagel lay.
Oh, Joan, this is my husband, Hank.
Wonderful!
We have tons of activities to occupy your time while Peggy plays bagel.
You look like you could use a wallet.
Would you like to make a wallet?
Uh, I don't think so.
Harley Davidson already made one for me.
Hank is not just my husband, he is also my coach.
Oh, well then you'll be needing one of these.
Come on, Peggy.
There's a Parker brother I want you to meet.
So take it from me, Chuck Manjoni.
Unplugging the iron feels so good.
Can you dig it?
Bobby, wait!
Use a coaster!
Uh-oh.
What have you done?
That coffee table is trashed.
Your parents trusted us, Bobby, and we let them down.
They won't be home for 48 hours.
I'll think of something.
Hey, I got it.
You think of something.
Checking in.
The name's Hank Hill.
Nope, I have a Peggy Hill.
Yeah, that's it.
Hank and Peggy Hill.
I have a Peggy Hill.
She's my wife.
Oh, okay.
Mr. and Mrs. Peggy Hill.
Now you listen to me.
The name is Hank Hill.
Mr. Hank Hill.
Peggy married me.
I didn't marry her.
What are you looking at?
Oh, look, Peggy.
It's Sissy Cobb, baggle champion of Dallas for seven-nine consecutive years.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Sissy, I am fellow boggle champ Peggy Hill.
My my, what an interesting jacket.
Did you patch that together yourself?
Well, actually, it was given to me by the Arlen Boggle Boosters.
They got local businesses to sponsor my trip.
Oh, how exciting.
Why, you're at the very beginning of a rags-to-riches story.
Okay, the guy at Home Depot said, all we gotta do is strip, sand, varnish, buff, varnish, buff, varnish, wax, buff.
Oh God, your parents are gonna be home in 47 hours, hurry!
No!
That was close.
Why, hello there.
Peggy Hill?
Name's Burnett.
Sissy Cobb's husband slash coach.
Uh, actually, my name... You don't have to explain.
I got an uncle named Leslie.
And the Duke himself, John Wayne, was really named Marion.
You take that back.
The state's not coming out.
And we'll put it on high.
Ah!
Oh.
Oh, Hank.
I have dreamt of this moment ever since I reached ages eight and up.
Yeah.
So I'll see you at dinner.
I gotta get to the mower show.
Well, you can't leave now.
You are my coach.
I need you.
You, of all people, should understand I am at state.
This is my moment.
You know, when I close my eyes, I see myself in the winter circle, and you are right there next to me.
My coach, my man.
And we drive back to Arlen with that big-ass boggle trophy mounted on the hood of your old truck like some beautiful gold-plated bare-breasted Rolls-Royce Angel.
Well, when I close my eyes, I see myself at the mower show.
And you're there, too.
Like some beauty queen of yore, wearing a fur coat and a gold hat.
All right, I'll stay.
Coaches, please clear the gaming floor.
Oh, I forgot.
Coaches have to watch from a closed circuit TV room.
Hold my purse.
Well, hello, Patches.
You must be here for your boggle lesson.
Bogglers, take your marks.
Oh, yeah.
Huh, valve cubes are running cold.
Ah, coach's note, it's a good day for sometimes why.
Hey Cobb, for 750 I can ride the mower that cut the grassy knoll.
Patina, pendant, panoply, and lobster.
Sissy Cobb, 73 points.
Peggy Hill, your words please.
Dang.
Dang is not a word.
That's just some backwoods patchwork.
Winner, Sissy Cobb, 73 to 0.
Dang.
I am so stupid.
Oh, you're not stupid.
Peck, you're smarter than me.
Oh, big deal.
Well, you're smarter than anyone else in Ireland.
Well, what do you do?
I am the smartest hillbilly in Hillbilly town.
I'm trying, Peggy.
I just... Hey, you know, Coach used to say something that would fire us up when we were behind.
Yeah, what?
Loser!
You're a loser!
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?
Well, you should be, because you are dirt!
You make me sick, you big baby!
Baby want a bottle?
A big dirt bottle?
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm trying to be your coach.
It's inspiring.
Well, thank you, because I feel worse than ever.
Well, it worked for the team.
No, it didn't.
You went to state and lost.
Oh, jeez.
I think I need one of those eight dollar beers.
You were right, Hank.
I am a loser.
I am 255 out of 256.
Oh, come on now.
You're still doing better than, uh, boggle playing chicken.
Coaches, please clear the gaming floor.
Well, I guess that's my cue.
You want me to hold your purse?
Fine.
This shouldn't take very long anyway.
Wow.
Would you look at this place?
I feel like... the pretty woman.
Uh, Hank?
Oh, hey guys.
Uh, what are you doing with that purse?
I'm holding it for Peggy.
Come on, man.
We're missing the mower show.
Let's go!
Well, maybe tomorrow.
What's going on here, Hank?
I got a pretty good dang old idea of what's going on.
I'll tell you what, man.
It's a...
Two days ago, you were like a little boy, all excited about the mower show.
Now you're this strange man holding a purse.
Which is it, Hank?
Are you some kind of man?
Are you a little boy?
I am still a little boy, dammit, and I'm still excited about going to the mower show.
Come on, let's go.
Winner, Peggy Hill.
Oh, I don't believe it.
You played a great game.
And on display in booth five, the blade from Sling Blade.
Liberace's mower, no flash photography.
Are you sure you can get that ring out?
Look, I can't afford any more screw-ups.
I just spent my last dollar on deodorizing carpet sealants.
What color is that?
Is that eggshell white?
It's gotta be Swiss coffee!
Oh, baby.
Oh, man.
Woo!
Winner, Peggy Hill.
Winner, Peggy Hill.
Winner, Peggy Hill.
I did it.
Guess what, Hank?
We are going to the finals.
Look at all those boomers rolling and dodging and such.
Hey, thanks for something to pick up that dang old rock.
Now, I tell you, I haven't had this much fun since our last football road trip.
Remember, when we went to state, no peg was there.
Remember?
Yeah, I remember.
Cheering her heart out when we were down 28 to nothing.
Man, this dang old piece of crap, dang old blocked up.
Get the rest out of there.
Ah!
I ain't got no fingers!
I'm sorry, Peggy.
We have to start the finals.
Okay.
As soon as I find my husband, I mean, Coach, he's probably just refilling my rosin bag.
Oh, don't kid yourself.
He's probably just too embarrassed to watch me beat you again.
Sissy cob.
That's right.
Patches.
Looks like it's you and me in the finals.
I...
Hello and welcome to the Texas State Boggle Championships.
We're coming to you live on the Dallas Grand Plaza Hospitality Channel.
I'm Brent Steele and with me is Boggle Grandmaster, Alexei Golgarin.
Thanks, Brent.
This should be a great final match.
Two great bogglers, only one will be winner.
Alright, it's going to be best of three.
I want a clean game.
No foreign words, no foreign objects.
Shake!
Sissy Cobb is off to an excellent start in round one.
Peggy Hill hesitated.
That's going to cost her at least a four leather word.
There goes Peggy Hill's pencil.
With no goat, she's really at a disadvantage.
Incredible.
What a scrapper.
What a save.
The players will now read their word lists starting with Peggy Hill.
Sad.
Abandoned.
Abandoned.
Bad.
Man.
We're in the final round of this championship match and Peggy Hill is far behind.
Peggy.
Peggy Hill is down to her last pencil.
She has no more pencils in reserve.
Everything rides on this pencil.
Ah, this is awful.
I think it's all over for Peggy Hill.
Hank, where the hell have you been?
It doesn't matter where I've been.
I figured out where I should be.
Now, let's show them how we play Boggle in Arlen.
Whatever you say, coach.
Peggy Hill was riding up a storm, but will it be enough?
Caviar.
Chinchilla.
Harpsichord.
With confidence, she wrote harpsichord, but not harp, and not chord.
Oh, a very bold gambit.
Fish.
Fish is.
Slaw.
Peggy Hill is using the opposite strategy, a long list of short words to narrow the gap.
Churn.
Churns.
Apron.
Aprons.
She needs ten more points and she only has one word remaining.
Ain't.
Ain't is not a word.
I win.
It ain't ain't sissy cob.
The word is acquaintance ship.
As in, it was not my pleasure to make your acquaintance ship.
I win.
What an incredible upset.
Peggy Hill is the new Texas State Buggle champion.
Now back to a description of the hotel fire safety procedures with your host, Chuck Manjoni.
You did it, Peggy.
You did it.
Just like you said, you're in the winner's circle.
And you are right beside me, Hank.
Loser!
You're a loser!
How you feelin' sorry for yourself?
Will you show me?
You know, there's something Coach Setty would do if we ever won the big game.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
My parents are gonna be home any minute!
What the hell is going on here?
This party is officially over.
You kids get out of here before I call your parents.
I don't know how you two could be so irresponsible.
You are both grounded.
What were you thinking?
You've got school tomorrow.
