1364	18489	Why do you say we tee off together, Hank?
18509	22455	Sure thing, Willie.
28063	29546	Dead solid perfect!
29666	30527	Ha ha!
38810	42682	You know, Hank, I've always wanted to sell propane and propane accessories like you do.
43284	45129	I guess this dang music thing came up.
46293	48078	Well, there ain't no change in the past, I guess.
48159	48921	Let's jam.
63869	69846	What in the name of dad?
72353	72914	Bobby!
74198	74318	Uh-oh.
104808	106651	Son, have you lost your mind?
106691	108493	Aren't you supposed to knock first?
108613	109715	I could have been naked.
109895	111798	Bobby, how many times have I told you?
112218	114041	Betsy is not a toy.
114401	120750	She's a 1963 Guild Solid Top... What's that smell?
121150	122873	You been playing this with your feet?
123153	124555	That's cheese, Dad.
125648	128776	Why would there ever be cheese on Betsy?
129257	130039	It's funny.
130360	131442	It's a comedy routine.
131783	135673	You know, you play the guitar with a piece of cheese and you go, hey, look at me.
135953	137658	I'm Eddie Cheddar.
139502	141126	You know it's from Celeryhead.
141308	143211	What is a celery head?
143491	145334	He's the world's best comedian.
145354	146415	He glues things.
146876	153946	Like he glues a clean Xbox to a tennis shoe and goes, this is in case you have a runny nose.
153966	155448	That's not a joke, son.
155728	157331	That's a waste of good glue.
157851	160415	Well, he makes $3 million a year.
160755	162077	You must have got that wrong.
162558	165262	People don't pay money to see things like that.
165883	168987	Now, Robert Klein, that's something you pay money for.
170097	171339	What is going on in there?
171399	173562	Thank you, I'm worried about our boy.
173842	177748	Some green-haired freak told him to rub cheese on my guitar.
178489	179851	Oh, you mean celery head.
180312	181994	I saw him on entertainment tonight.
182715	184518	He makes three million dollars a year.
186902	189666	Luan, good lord, put on some pants.
189986	190948	I'm wearing shorts.
192209	194012	Don't scare me like that.
196186	198729	Look at this, Peggy, the boy chipped Betsy's bridge.
199409	202633	And he woke me up from my Willie Nelson golfing dream number three.
203033	205756	I, calm down, it is just a bunch of wood and some wires.
206056	206877	Wood and wires?
207638	209540	I've had Betsy since high school.
210020	211081	I took her to the prom.
211762	213123	I love this guitar.
213584	214925	Do you understand what I'm saying?
214945	217288	Do you understand what love means?
217308	219270	Yes, I love my family.
219530	220491	Yeah, now you're getting it.
220831	223594	That's the kind of love I have for Betsy.
223810	226132	I'm going back to sleep, you coming?
226753	227333	I'm already up.
227974	230476	Besides, I wouldn't want to make Betsy jealous.
231217	234020	Luanne, would you please not sit like that?
234040	240946	I sell propane and propane accessories, I tell you what.
241386	242587	Shut up, Dale!
248173	249033	Oh, Willie, no!
249254	250695	That's a one-way street!
251890	254593	Right, Bobby.
254613	255133	What happened to my truck?
255153	255514	Your mower hit it.
255534	259538	Well, maybe I ought to send my mower to one of those children psychologists.
262321	263943	Are you mad about something, Aunt Peggy?
264403	264763	Mad.
265184	266065	Why would I be mad?
266085	269609	Just because Hank pays more attention to that silly guitar than he does to me.
272512	273993	Lay off the gas, Aunt Peggy.
274033	276476	If I break another nail, I'll fail my manicure final.
276816	278598	Are you having trouble at the beauty academy, Louie?
279259	279619	No.
280730	283153	I'm also failing braid work.
283173	285936	Braid work does not come natural to the women in our family, honey.
286617	289861	You know it, I know it, and the whole town knows it.
289881	291884	Sounds like your whore's going off.
292284	294026	You really think so, Bill?
295228	295448	Oh, yeah.
296249	297070	Damn it, Hank.
297110	300895	You know I can't have loud, sudden noises while I'm meditating.
301355	304499	I was a nose hair away from attaining inner peace.
307363	309285	Don't even try to take credit for that.
309620	311282	It was not done by me.
311863	313466	It was done through me.
315509	317311	What is that chinging noise?
318313	322799	One of those stealth helicopters with computerized noise cancellation capability.
324562	326064	They're still working the chings out.
326445	328788	How'd you know about stealth helicopters?
328808	332033	Alt dot conspiracy dot black dot helicopters.
332249	334398	Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, that dang old internet, man.
334418	340261	You just go on there and point and click, get in there and talk about www.duby.com and you got that naked chicks on there, man.
340281	342008	You just go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
342029	343153	It's real easy, man.
346475	347897	Bobby, give me that club!
348539	350762	Son, maybe I'm not getting through to you.
351183	352004	Let me explain.
352585	355010	You gotta respect other people's things.
355571	359397	You do not use a man's pitching wedge to hit clumps of mud.
359718	361060	It's not mud, dad.
361561	362342	It's dog dew.
364406	365347	Boy ain't right.
366169	367230	Oh yeah!
367251	367932	Excellent workout.
368052	369534	I got my rotator cuff rotating.
369755	371638	My face feels weird.
372530	373171	Carlos!
373652	374253	Carlos?
374633	376276	You name your things, I'll name mine.
376576	378419	Well, what about that thing named Bobby?
378739	379981	What are we going to do about him?
380522	383506	He seems bent on destroying everything I own.
383887	386511	Why can't he turn that energy into something useful?
387031	390356	Like that boy with no legs who ran across Canada.
390496	394182	Maybe you need to spend some time together, you know, just talking you and Bobby.
394542	395764	Mano a mano.
396005	398368	Well, I can't now, I'm going golfing.
399125	401568	Peg, we're riding to full 18 holes today.
402089	404452	You know what that kind of stress can do to a boy?
406996	412243	Bobby, I apologize for yelling at you, but sometimes you just don't listen.
412923	416168	It's like you got a problem with concentration.
418090	418411	Bobby?
419412	419773	Bobby?
420654	421555	Bobby!
422277	423139	Hey!
423159	424481	You just killed me!
424501	425703	Well, you needed killing.
426385	430893	You know, I've been thinking, son, and I realized you don't have any goals.
431594	434660	You gotta figure out what you wanna do with your life.
435181	437265	Okay, can we go to Six Flags?
438848	440870	I think you need a role model, Bobby.
441471	443674	Someone to emulate, a hero.
444315	447659	Someone besides that broccoli neck.
447679	449661	How about Eddie Stilson?
449681	451383	Can I emulate him?
451403	453346	Now there you go, Eddie Stilson.
453967	457891	Which one's he, the space shuttle astronaut or the stock car champ?
458092	460755	He got to the end of level six and screamed ninja.
461022	465807	Bobby, when I say hero, I don't mean some weird Game Boy freak.
466348	469371	If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.
470952	472354	Deal me out this hand, Jason.
473495	474516	I'm about to bust.
475377	477659	Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom.
477720	478600	Oh, good lord!
481483	482785	You know Howard Adderley?
483245	485848	He's my number two hero after Eddie Stilson.
486790	489573	Bobby, you need to be lectured all afternoon.
490074	492497	Peggy, I'm taking the boy golfing, and that's that.
500766	501707	Careful now, Peggy.
501767	503349	Betsy isn't strapped in yet.
503970	506933	Oh, do not tell me you are taking that thing golfing with you now.
507194	508355	Don't be silly, Peg.
508856	510397	Just bring her in to get fixed.
511018	511879	Sit in the middle, son.
512460	515143	I want to make sure Betsy's in front of the airbag.
516288	518731	So Bobby, we gotta think of a hero for you.
519171	521154	Do you have a hero, Dad?
521174	523376	I sure do, and it's Willie Nelson.
523837	524377	How cool.
524878	528042	Well, you might say he's been my inspiration.
528843	532687	See, Willie grew up in Texas, and I grew up in Texas.
532707	534790	He loves golfing and playing guitar.
535470	537152	I love golfing and playing guitar.
537753	545502	He's had trouble with the IRS, and I must have spent six hours last April on that 1040 form.
545633	546998	Easy, my ass.
547841	549346	Do you have a hero like that?
550671	552758	Uh, Willie Nelson?
554020	557786	You're just saying Willie Nelson because I said Willie Nelson.
558006	559769	No, I like Willie Nelson.
560089	561071	He's got long hair.
561471	562773	He's alternative.
562793	564035	Now you take that back.
564616	572268	I followed that man from country western to country to adult contemporary and that's as far as I'm going.
572288	574111	Here son, take a look at that.
574752	578357	That's Willie Nelson's own personal golf course.
581240	584645	I am going to show that brain machine who's boss, Aunt Peggy.
584925	585667	Go on the wind.
585947	587990	Show this town there's a braider in the family.
590474	591395	I'm not scared of you.
591575	593378	This time I'm going to beat you at your own game.
601330	602792	Miss Cramsire!
605978	607240	It's the bridge, isn't it?
607801	609224	Well, bridge is the symptom.
609665	611328	Frat asymmetry is the disease.
611388	615556	Smells like a belly button.
615856	618281	Yeah, my son was playing it with a piece of cheese.
618702	620545	You mean like celery head?
621470	623653	Look, I'm Camembert Humperdinger.
623933	627918	Les, go in the back and alphabetize the guitar strings.
627938	630362	Now alphabetize by letter or... Les.
630582	631343	Okay.
631683	632404	All right.
632424	634747	Geez or not, this is a sweet, sweet guitar.
635448	636189	Is she for sale?
636490	637071	Not hardly.
637451	638653	Just fix the bridge, Earl.
639434	640315	Oh, I didn't think so.
640875	645081	Most guys would sell their wives before they'd sell a guitar like this.
645061	647383	I gotta remember that one.
648445	649966	Oh, heck, I got a million of them.
649986	652068	Like, women are a lot like a guitar.
652248	653790	They both come with strings attached.
657894	660217	Oh, actually, I guess those are the only two.
660657	662699	Most women will be threatened by Betsy, but not me.
662739	663160	I don't care.
664401	668505	And I would like to see that guitar come home and chicken fry a steak after substitute teaching all day.
669286	671408	Ow.
671428	673110	Well, thank you, Mrs. Hellman.
679267	680489	Santa Claus!
680849	681890	What are you talking about?
682171	683112	Santa Claus!
683152	686176	He could be the boy's hero in one twenty-four hour period.
686196	688759	He delivers toys and enjoyed every child on earth.
689119	690822	Santa Claus is for babies.
691582	693204	You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
699212	701595	Damn Russian titanium, my lord.
716695	717776	Huh.
717796	720199	Maybe it's just first-hold jitters.
720219	721361	Got any tips, boomhauer?
721741	722102	Yeah, man.
722122	723163	I'll tell you what you do, man.
723183	724985	You just gotta keep that thing of warm straight, man.
725005	726707	Y'all put your left hand still, man.
726727	728289	Just speed it the hell up.
728550	729210	Let's roll.
729671	730372	Come on, Bobby.
735238	735899	Oh, man.
736299	737421	I'm out of cigarettes.
738162	739243	This ain't gonna get yoked.
739263	740965	It has to... four.
741603	744147	Mr. Gribble, who's your all-time hero?
744468	746411	You are, if you get me some smokes.
747292	751139	So the stripper says to the priest... Build the boy.
752861	758791	She says I decided to repent and become a nun.
760333	761155	And I owe a nun.
762016	764220	That's pretty funny.
764240	765842	Hey, Dad, watch this.
765862	767425	No, no, son, don't.
769598	770880	All right, Bobby.
771060	772402	Well, I'll be.
773243	777911	Son, you just might be the next Lee Trevino without the crazy accent.
778572	781075	Tell you what, I'm going to let you tee off on this hole.
781516	781977	Okay.
784400	785502	That's okay, Bobby.
785562	786143	You can do it.
786303	790189	Just choke up on it and swing less like a girl.
794658	796740	I get a do-over.
797381	798662	Bobby, hop in.
799042	801044	Hank, dispose of the witnesses.
801905	803187	Dale, come back here.
803247	807691	Willie Nelson.
808992	810834	Check his pockets for cigarettes.
813877	816780	Willie Nelson, oh my lord, are you okay?
817120	818282	Am I bleeding from the ears?
818622	818922	No.
820224	821745	Then I must be okay then.
822485	825468	Oh, Mr. Nelson, I am so sorry.
826109	830214	My boy is new to golf and oh gosh, I'm your biggest fan.
830514	832036	I go to every concert I can.
832376	834578	I've been to every farm aid except one.
835139	837362	I don't much care for that Brian Adams.
837682	840745	Damn, I wish I had my guitar here with me for you to sign.
840785	847092	Here, why don't you make it out to, let's say, to my best friend.
847453	852238	No, no, I don't want you to lie to my good friend.
852218	853401	Hmm.
853421	856146	To my number one fan, Hank Hill.
857249	858451	Uh, hey, hey, Willie.
858471	859995	You know, I play guitar too.
860836	864484	I also play golf, but you already know that.
864504	868493	But you probably don't know you're, uh, you're my hero.
869094	870497	He took our cart.
870713	871895	Was he bleeding from the ears?
872436	872676	No.
873217	874239	Well, he must be okay then.
874539	876001	You don't understand, Peg.
876502	880108	A man only gets a chance to meet Willie Nelson once in his life.
880629	882131	It's supposed to be special.
882812	886718	We meet on the golf course, he compliments my perfect swing.
887339	893369	We start talking about music, cut an album, go on tour, open a chicken franchise.
894270	895692	How's that gonna happen now?
896473	898797	It's my fault forever, taking the boy with me.
899603	901026	I said I was sorry.
901969	903512	Um, are you Hank Hill?
904194	905597	Uh, yes.
907261	908945	I'm tired of being lack of focus.
909366	910930	I'm gonna show them I can do better.
911391	912874	I'm gonna make my dad proud.
915280	917545	I'm gonna not tell dad about that.
941791	944014	Hey, is that Ben Crenshaw Turbo Golf?
944415	945336	Yeah.
945516	947799	I can never get it past the bunker on the third hole.
947819	950623	Try letting it go just below the mark on your drive.
951324	952045	Hey, I know you.
952165	953547	You're the kid that rakes my lawn.
953767	955650	No, I'm the kid who hit you in the head.
956030	956491	With a rake?
956891	958113	No, with a golf club.
958393	960136	You've been raking my yard with a golf club?
960156	961097	I want my quarter back.
964021	964742	Hill residents?
964962	967005	Dad, guess where I am?
967238	968339	I don't know, let's see.
968479	971542	Crushing Dwight Yoakum's voice box with my five iron?
972263	974846	I'm at Willie Nelson's, and he wants you to come over!
975206	977548	Son, you're teasing the gorilla in the monkey house.
977869	978689	Willie Nelson here.
979290	981893	Practically blind in one eye now, but I got your son here.
982813	984475	I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Nelson.
984795	987778	Bobby's never stalked anyone before, and he's not very good at it.
988279	990381	I mean, well, he shouldn't be stalking anybody.
990961	992503	I'll come get him right away.
1004735	1005196	Bobby?
1005837	1006197	Bobby?
1006237	1008221	Outta my way, rooster boy.
1012688	1013129	Betsy?
1014771	1015272	What the?
1016234	1017015	Hey, Dad!
1017035	1017496	Hey, Hank.
1017896	1019338	Bobby's been telling me all about you.
1019719	1023004	I hear you're a guitar player, and that you got a narrow urethra.
1023305	1023766	Bobby?
1024246	1025769	Yeah, and he had me autograph your guitar.
1026089	1027472	You signed my guitar?
1027972	1030236	To my number one fan, Willie Nelson.
1031279	1037507	The fox chases the rabbit around the tree trunk and gets into the house.
1039549	1039849	I was so close.
1039869	1040490	Hill residents.
1040771	1041832	Peggy, you'll never guess.
1042212	1043574	I'm at Willie Nelson's house.
1043914	1046077	He says we're all invited to his barbecue.
1046097	1049561	Gee, I'd love to come, Hank, but Ann Richards and I are doing our toenails.
1049902	1050863	I don't think so, Peggy.
1050923	1054527	I'm looking at Ann Richards right now and she's playing tetherball with one of my roadies.
1054968	1055989	See, that was him.
1056470	1059193	Oh, my lord, what do I wear?
1059781	1061204	Peg, where any old thing?
1061545	1065433	Oh, just don't forget to bring Betsy's orange woven shoulder strap.
1066455	1068258	Betsy sure is a beaut, Hank.
1068278	1069641	I think Trigger's getting jealous.
1069962	1071004	Well, thank you, Willie.
1071385	1072908	Sure means a lot coming from you.
1072948	1074872	You know what they say?
1074892	1080203	I'd sell my wife before I'd sell my guitar.
1081600	1084804	I tell you what, man, you did that dang ol' mid-mid-midst of the tambourine, man.
1084824	1090511	Somebody did come play a song for me, you know, then you got to change your name to Zimmerman, y'all born again.
1090571	1096798	Well, a whole bunch of kids coming around and, hey, mad dog, ten of them going platinum.
1096938	1100442	You know those accounting firms and that dang ol' boomer.
1101163	1104307	Uh, ma'am, you're gonna want to angle that glass.
1105408	1106970	Uh-uh, you're blowing it.
1107451	1110975	You're gonna get nothing but foam.
1110995	1111135	Mm-hmm.
1115148	1117611	You know, Mr. Hopper, I just loved you in that movie.
1117971	1120214	You know, the one where you played a mad villain.
1120234	1122136	Come on, Peggy, you wild thing.
1122416	1124639	Let's drive straight down to Mexico, huh?
1124659	1125800	Come on, right this minute.
1126441	1127021	Mexico.
1127702	1130105	I wonder what a wife goes for down there, huh?
1130125	1131567	One guitar, two guitars.
1132087	1135932	I will have to ask Hank.
1135952	1138254	Los Mariachi's so deablos.
1138474	1139956	He's not treating you right, Peggy.
1140517	1142539	A delicate flower like you.
1142587	1144371	You want me to kick his ass?
1145152	1147277	Oh, you are so sweet to offer, Dennis.
1147838	1149542	But Hank would flatten you out like a bug.
1149582	1153831	No, this is something Peggy Hill has to handle on her own.
1154612	1155534	Oh yeah!
1155554	1156817	Haha, you go girl!
1161347	1162890	That's some boy you got there, Hank.
1165756	1167919	Well, it's nice of you to say that, Willie.
1168280	1170443	But Bobby's got no direction in life.
1170783	1171544	No heroes.
1172345	1174308	When I was his age, I worshipped you.
1174949	1177192	And Jesus, of course.
1177212	1178594	Ever think you're too tough on the boy?
1179135	1179736	Oh, I don't know.
1180236	1188268	Just today, he chipped Betsy's bridge, ran into my truck with the mower, dinged up my favorite wedge, and then dinged you up worse.
1188568	1189750	Well, now hold on there, Hank.
1189770	1190471	You think about it.
1190731	1195678	Bobby wants to play your guitar, ride your mower, and swing your golf club.
1195658	1199283	I believe that kid does have a hero, and his name is Hank Hall.
1200064	1201006	Uh, Hill.
1201566	1202087	Uh, yeah, right.
1203008	1203329	Bobby?
1205071	1205392	Bobby?
1206193	1206573	Bobby!
1206634	1207675	What?
1207695	1214565	I just want to, uh, thank you for helping me meet my hero and having him sign my guitar.
1214965	1216768	I helped him put Whiteman in his eye.
1217168	1221835	Now I'm gonna show you something you can do with a guitar that doesn't involve cheese.
1223300	1225944	This is a song I wrote a long time ago.
1230893	1233237	Well, I know a gal with the purdy legs.
1233817	1237283	She's a gal who can fry my eggs.
1237303	1241090	And her name is Peggy.
1242352	1248582	Well, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy.
1249169	1251231	my pig leg.
1252272	1256475	Well, I love you and I love you, Peggy Pig.
1256495	1260619	Well, uh, then it just sort of goes off into a buddy holly riff.
1261480	1262321	Oh, Hank.
1262601	1266044	Peggy, oh, I didn't realize you were there.
1266524	1268266	Here, Bobby, go practice.
1268286	1269747	Are you sure it's okay for me?
1269767	1269947	Yeah.
1270688	1273831	You know, I was headed over here to knock you six ways from Sunday with that guitar.
1274351	1277674	Then I get here and you're playing that old song years and
1278582	1280305	out.
1280325	1285876	I love you, propane man.
1288601	1295494	You braided that perfect lumen, but next time lighten up a little on the glitter spray.
1302359	1323673	He's got hold of this a little longer before we go ahead.
1323693	1325556	Now?
1325576	1329683	That's a good start.
