WEBVTT

00:12.907 --> 00:16.134
Hey, my dad's invitation to the party got returned.

00:16.595 --> 00:19.923
Grandpa Cotton Hill Hell USA?

00:20.564 --> 00:22.248
Bobby, why'd you write this?

00:22.308 --> 00:24.172
You know your grandpa lives in Houston?

00:24.553 --> 00:26.036
Mom says he's the devil.

00:26.297 --> 00:28.722
Peggy, how can you tell Bobby that?

00:28.702 --> 00:30.444
I said evil Hank.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.247
How you get devil from that is beyond me.

00:32.808 --> 00:34.610
I don't want grandpa at my party.

00:34.871 --> 00:38.496
The kids are already gonna hate me because you got the wrong kind of bean dip.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.678
What's wrong with the bean dip?

00:40.299 --> 00:40.939
Wait a minute.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.402
What's wrong with your grandpa?

00:42.522 --> 00:44.244
He's got big plastic teeth.

00:44.525 --> 00:45.906
He screams all the time.

00:46.187 --> 00:47.689
His legs don't work.

00:47.669 --> 00:50.754
Bobby, never make funny your grandpa's legs.

00:51.255 --> 00:55.421
He lost his shins defending Texas in World War II.

00:56.022 --> 01:00.549
Now, son, pick up that phone and invite your granddad to your birthday party.

01:01.130 --> 01:01.872
Okay.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.280
Hi, Grandpa.

01:07.300 --> 01:12.208
Bobby, if you're gonna fake dial, you gotta hit more than three numbers.

01:42.935 --> 01:45.400
Woo!

01:45.420 --> 01:51.892
This thing is a hoof!

01:51.912 --> 01:54.056
Uh, I got a splinter here.

01:54.417 --> 01:57.082
Orange, you glad I didn't say banana?

01:58.204 --> 01:59.106
Huh?

01:59.126 --> 02:00.008
Huh?

02:00.028 --> 02:01.591
This party's boring.

02:02.192 --> 02:03.795
Everybody hates you.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.220
Why are you so pissed off for Piggy Hill?

02:06.641 --> 02:07.262
Oh, nothing.

02:07.282 --> 02:08.103
Just Hank's father.

02:08.264 --> 02:09.586
He's driving in for the party.

02:09.887 --> 02:11.570
Oh, Lord, that crazy Cotton Hill.

02:11.850 --> 02:15.857
I heard after Hank's mother left Cotton, he married his 16-year-old nurse.

02:16.077 --> 02:17.841
Dee Dee is 39, thank you very much.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.185
Although parts of her are much younger.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.088
Ooh, Piggy Hill.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.863
Dad, I'm dying out there.

02:27.224 --> 02:29.227
I blew up a balloon with my nose.

02:29.568 --> 02:29.988
Nothing.

02:30.509 --> 02:31.711
I did this thing.

02:32.492 --> 02:34.055
What are you talking about?

02:34.456 --> 02:35.998
What are you talking about?

02:36.539 --> 02:37.080
Nothing.

02:37.521 --> 02:39.604
Did you try burping the alphabet?

02:39.985 --> 02:42.068
That's my clothes, Dad.

02:42.419 --> 02:44.402
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

02:44.422 --> 02:45.885
What are you talking about, man?

02:45.905 --> 02:48.008
I tell you what, Fat Kid's always funny one, man.

02:48.028 --> 02:52.015
There's a thing called John Candy, John Belushi, Knife and Pork, dug their grave, man.

02:52.035 --> 02:53.036
Who wants a burger?

02:53.657 --> 02:54.839
Well, I'll take that steak.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.141
The hell you say?

02:56.182 --> 02:57.844
Did you win World War II?

02:58.405 --> 03:00.068
This ribeye is for my daddy.

03:00.288 --> 03:01.390
Cotton's coming.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.261
Whoa-ho, if I was you, Con, I'd am-scray before he gets here.

03:06.341 --> 03:09.466
Yeah, if he finds out you're from Japan, you know.

03:09.807 --> 03:14.294
How many times I tell you, stupid, I'm Le Ocean!

03:14.314 --> 03:16.137
Uh, you?

03:16.157 --> 03:18.400
Uh, Vee?

03:24.607 --> 03:27.797
Happy birthday, Bobby!

03:27.817 --> 03:29.783
Oh, Dad, you crazy son of a gun.

03:29.964 --> 03:31.910
You really outdid yourself this time.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.054
Well, you know me.

03:33.174 --> 03:34.498
I'm larger than life.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.038
Where are its legs?

03:41.058 --> 03:42.561
What are you looking at, Moe?

03:42.581 --> 03:45.245
A Japanese machine gun blew my shins off in WW2.

03:46.587 --> 03:47.188
So what?

03:47.890 --> 03:48.871
You like that horse, Bobby?

03:49.172 --> 03:50.534
I love it, Grandpa!

03:50.774 --> 03:52.938
Well, you can love it for four more hours.

03:53.319 --> 03:53.840
It's a riddle.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.243
All right, who wants the first ride?

03:57.726 --> 03:57.786
Me!

04:00.280 --> 04:01.241
Hey, Hank's wife.

04:01.562 --> 04:02.984
Well, how long have you been here, Cotton?

04:03.605 --> 04:04.706
I didn't notice you... Didi!

04:05.187 --> 04:07.029
Come on out here and gab with Hank's wife.

04:07.630 --> 04:08.431
Look at here, Hank.

04:08.912 --> 04:11.736
What do you think of your mama's new tie ties?

04:11.756 --> 04:13.598
Oh, she is not my mother.

04:13.698 --> 04:15.421
Hell, we went to kindergarten together.

04:16.021 --> 04:16.542
Hey, Hank.

04:17.563 --> 04:19.786
Do you still like finger painting?

04:21.008 --> 04:23.532
Everyone thinks your party's cool, Bobby.

04:24.052 --> 04:25.114
I'm having fun.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.537
Your wife divorced you.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.718
Mr. Kahn, I'll have a Mai Tai.

04:37.119 --> 04:38.301
What do you think?

04:38.782 --> 04:39.583
I look for Hank?

04:40.465 --> 04:42.309
Dad, this here is my new neighbor.

04:42.890 --> 04:44.112
He's Japanese.

04:44.573 --> 04:45.595
No, he ain't.

04:47.819 --> 04:48.681
He's Laotian.

04:49.362 --> 04:50.785
Thank you, Mr. Kahn.

04:53.671 --> 04:56.376
All right, time to open my gift.

04:58.432 --> 04:58.893
Whoa!

04:59.193 --> 05:00.615
A super squirter!

05:01.056 --> 05:02.778
A two-bar squirter!

05:02.918 --> 05:05.061
There ain't no water at all, Mr. Khan!

05:05.501 --> 05:08.626
It's a genuine Winchester 20-gauge shotgun!

05:08.886 --> 05:10.708
You got a real gun!

05:11.189 --> 05:12.811
And now Peggy Hill has a real gun.

05:13.192 --> 05:15.154
Bobby, you are too young to own a firearm, honey.

05:15.595 --> 05:16.656
Did you see that, Hank?

05:16.997 --> 05:19.360
Tell your woman to give him back his gun!

05:19.340 --> 05:20.101
His woman?

05:20.822 --> 05:21.282
Oh, God.

05:22.043 --> 05:24.066
I am my own woman, and don't you forget.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.729
Oh, Peg, uh, that's just cowboy talk.

05:26.769 --> 05:27.189
Come on.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.992
Hey, let's go bust open that piñata.

05:30.513 --> 05:33.176
Kill the boy!

05:33.196 --> 05:33.717
Ooh, Bastard!

05:33.737 --> 05:34.017
Bastard!

05:34.037 --> 05:34.718
Come on, Bobby.

05:34.738 --> 05:36.480
Hank, the boy can barely reach it.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.503
Now, lower the piñata so he has a chance at it.

05:39.524 --> 05:39.944
Come on.

05:43.488 --> 05:43.648
Oh!

05:43.849 --> 05:44.790
Crap it!

05:44.810 --> 05:45.631
Feel it!

05:45.651 --> 05:47.513
Ooh, Bastard!

05:47.533 --> 05:47.693
Bastard!

05:53.967 --> 05:55.309
Kill it, boy!

05:55.789 --> 05:59.835
It must be made of kryptonite or something.

05:59.855 --> 06:01.417
We're crying out loud!

06:02.278 --> 06:03.299
Oh, good Lord Cotton!

06:03.540 --> 06:05.162
You gave him a loaded shotgun?

06:05.462 --> 06:07.525
Well, you don't give a toile without batteries.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.890
Come and get your Tootsie Rolls!

06:11.651 --> 06:15.255
Oh, I'm so sorry your grandpa ruined your birthday, son.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.237
He didn't ruin it.

06:16.397 --> 06:17.378
He made it fine.

06:17.939 --> 06:20.262
Bobby, come on over here, boy.

06:22.030 --> 06:23.193
Take off them pink love.

06:23.694 --> 06:24.697
That's women's work.

06:24.957 --> 06:25.799
Leave him alone.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.102
He's a good helper.

06:27.503 --> 06:29.428
Oh, whatever you say, Hillary.

06:32.155 --> 06:33.799
Cotton, I'll do the dishes.

06:34.441 --> 06:35.082
I like to.

06:35.363 --> 06:36.466
Permission granted.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.533
Put an apron over your new bosom, too.

06:39.935 --> 06:41.456
Don't tell her, but I got them cheap.

06:41.777 --> 06:42.497
Both lefties!

06:43.358 --> 06:45.600
So, Bobby, what's it gonna do with your life?

06:45.921 --> 06:47.822
I'm gonna be a prop comic.

06:47.842 --> 06:51.266
I'm working on this bit where I stick a green bean up my nose.

06:51.726 --> 06:53.047
Well, now that sounds promising.

06:53.648 --> 06:58.413
Hank, Bobby and me have decided he's gonna stick vegetables up his nose.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.675
He's not gonna take over the family gas station.

07:00.695 --> 07:03.117
Dad, I don't work at a gas station.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.639
I sell propane and propane accessories.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.680
Don't sass me, boy!

07:07.041 --> 07:09.503
You ain't too big for me to give you a licking!

07:09.483 --> 07:12.588
Oh, dad, you old skunk.

07:12.608 --> 07:13.650
Come on, grease monkey.

07:13.931 --> 07:14.692
Let's tangle.

07:15.433 --> 07:16.836
All right, Kyle.

07:16.916 --> 07:18.338
Now, you are breaking my good dishes.

07:18.619 --> 07:19.681
It's time for you to leave.

07:20.903 --> 07:21.343
Come on.

07:21.363 --> 07:21.924
Come on.

07:21.944 --> 07:25.190
I will fix you a to-go plate.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.452
Don't worry about the horse.

07:26.472 --> 07:28.656
If it comes back, we'll call the rental place.

07:32.095 --> 07:33.356
Damn, won't start.

07:33.977 --> 07:35.258
I guess I'm not going anywhere.

07:35.578 --> 07:36.379
Oh, no, no, no.

07:36.559 --> 07:37.280
Just pop the hood.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.661
Hank can fix it in a minute.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.382
Don't bother, Uncle Hank.

07:40.823 --> 07:42.464
I can't hear the solenoid plunger.

07:42.985 --> 07:44.066
You're going to need a new one.

07:44.486 --> 07:45.427
Thanks a lot, girly.

07:46.047 --> 07:47.929
But the truth is, you're a girl.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.873
Hank, we'll have to wait till your gas station opens up in the morning.

07:51.893 --> 07:52.873
I guess I'm staying over.

07:53.154 --> 07:55.576
I wish you could, but we are all out of beds.

07:55.596 --> 07:56.356
I don't need a bed.

07:57.498 --> 08:01.461
I can sleep in a drawer after what they did to me overseas.

08:01.762 --> 08:03.564
I could sleep on the couch, Mom.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.846
Well, that'll be just fine.

08:05.046 --> 08:06.749
Excuse me for just a second.

08:06.769 --> 08:11.255
I do not want that ill-mannered foul mouth old man to spend another moment in my house.

08:11.535 --> 08:13.558
Oh, you just don't understand him, Peg.

08:13.979 --> 08:17.583
See, he's a big flamboyant character like a peacock.

08:17.924 --> 08:19.146
That's why men love him.

08:19.506 --> 08:23.471
But women don't like his style because you all are like the pee hen.

08:23.952 --> 08:26.115
More subdued and drab.

08:27.023 --> 08:30.068
You just cannot see your father for who he is.

08:30.389 --> 08:32.372
Well, Bobby and I both want him to stay.

08:32.873 --> 08:34.356
So that means you're out voted.

08:34.636 --> 08:34.937
Oh, yeah?

08:35.317 --> 08:36.459
Well, Luann hates him, too.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.862
That means we're even.

08:38.342 --> 08:40.666
Well, Jesus loves him, so I win.

08:41.167 --> 08:44.453
Well, what does that have to do with... Hey, Dad, we'd love it if you stayed.

08:44.854 --> 08:45.695
Well, all righty.

08:46.336 --> 08:50.804
Bitty, we're bunking here tonight.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.727
Mr. Khan, my bag!

08:57.297 --> 08:59.503
What do you say I drive you to school today, Bobby?

09:00.024 --> 09:01.789
Hey, you fix my car yet?

09:02.150 --> 09:03.213
I just woke up.

09:03.513 --> 09:04.315
Just what?

09:04.336 --> 09:05.519
It's 7 a.m.

09:05.559 --> 09:08.727
If you were in the army, you could have dug 10 graves by now.

09:09.228 --> 09:10.632
I hope you're all hungry.

09:10.848 --> 09:12.470
Good looking breakfast, Peg.

09:12.911 --> 09:14.333
Yeah, I see bacon.

09:14.914 --> 09:15.755
I see ham.

09:16.416 --> 09:17.257
I see steak.

09:17.898 --> 09:18.919
Sausage!

09:18.939 --> 09:19.860
Where's my sausage?

09:20.141 --> 09:21.342
There's no sausage!

09:21.583 --> 09:27.571
Well, Cotton, you are welcome to march yourself down to the safeway, but I have to get ready for work.

09:28.653 --> 09:29.113
See you, Bobby.

09:29.674 --> 09:30.255
Woman works.

09:30.755 --> 09:32.157
Man loses his sausage.

09:33.339 --> 09:39.167
You know, Cotton, I'd love to debate this with you, but I am just a little too busy living here in the latter half of the 20th century.

09:39.873 --> 09:43.037
Hey dad, if you want to drive Bobby to school, use my truck.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.279
I'll go rig up your pedal extenders.

09:47.041 --> 09:48.903
You're all skin and bones, girly.

09:49.504 --> 09:51.626
Put some cornpone on them hips.

09:51.646 --> 09:53.488
I don't want any grandpa hell.

09:53.869 --> 09:54.810
Don't want to get fat.

09:55.310 --> 09:56.572
That's not for you to worry about.

09:57.092 --> 09:59.174
You will never know if you are attractive.

09:59.655 --> 10:01.117
It's up to a man to tell you that.

10:01.617 --> 10:04.260
You keep eating, and I'll tell you when to stop.

10:04.645 --> 10:07.489
Touch me again and go be wearing that cornpone, old man.

10:08.410 --> 10:08.690
Really?

10:09.271 --> 10:09.832
Feisty!

10:13.957 --> 10:17.041
You sure it's okay for me to be out of school today, Grandpa?

10:17.441 --> 10:19.123
Well, yeah, it's a holiday, isn't it?

10:19.684 --> 10:21.346
It's Angie Dickinson's birthday.

10:22.027 --> 10:24.430
Now, why don't you order us some food?

10:24.450 --> 10:24.790
Really?

10:25.571 --> 10:27.434
Dad never lets me order.

10:27.454 --> 10:28.955
Yeah, well, you went with your daddy today.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.197
Go to it.

10:32.118 --> 10:34.121
Excuse me, ma'am.

10:35.563 --> 10:35.763
Uh, ma'am.

10:35.783 --> 10:35.963
Oh, good.

10:35.983 --> 10:36.104
Sweet.

10:36.124 --> 10:36.945
You'll never get no service that way.

10:36.965 --> 10:38.948
You gotta get her in the moneymaker.

10:38.968 --> 10:39.188
Hey, Missy.

10:39.208 --> 10:39.809
How about some sandwiches?

10:39.869 --> 10:51.325
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

10:52.570 --> 10:54.032
Well, that's the dangedest thing.

10:54.092 --> 10:57.416
I never heard of a solenoid just disappearing before.

10:58.017 --> 10:58.518
I don't know.

10:58.918 --> 11:02.182
Sometimes things just disappear for no logical reason.

11:02.843 --> 11:05.827
One day my cousin woke up, his kidney was gone.

11:06.488 --> 11:13.457
At the same time, five hundred miles away, a woman in Phoenix contracted diabetes.

11:14.318 --> 11:15.760
I fixed it, Uncle Hank.

11:19.570 --> 11:21.072
Oh, he purrs.

11:21.092 --> 11:22.455
He's like, dang, old kid.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.720
Yep, my dad sure knows how to take care of his cars.

11:26.381 --> 11:34.875
When I was a baby, he had my mama make me a shammy jumpsuit, and I used to crawl around on the hood and buff it till it shined like Christmas.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.038
Your dad, I swear.

11:37.719 --> 11:41.065
How about when he took us down to the hotel, Arlen?

11:41.085 --> 11:41.986
Oh, yeah.

11:42.046 --> 11:43.148
Remember that, Hank?

11:48.325 --> 11:50.788
Hank, you won the big game.

11:50.808 --> 11:54.412
So, I'm buying you and your friends hookers.

11:54.913 --> 11:56.735
Now come on, boys, pickers out that'll have one.

11:57.255 --> 11:58.877
Hey there, Mr. Quarterback.

12:02.361 --> 12:05.165
Not every dad would do something like that to his son.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.987
I mean, for his son.

12:10.331 --> 12:12.133
What, how's it coming with the car, grease monkey?

12:12.553 --> 12:14.215
That's real funny, Peg.

12:14.313 --> 12:15.294
Look what I found.

12:16.015 --> 12:17.858
Wait, that's a solenoid.

12:17.898 --> 12:18.759
Where'd you find that?

12:19.040 --> 12:23.526
In Cotton's room, wrapped in his little bitty pants under a big pile of lies.

12:24.027 --> 12:26.651
Damn it, I killed a whole day fixing that car.

12:27.111 --> 12:27.993
I don't understand.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.735
Oh, Hank, what is to understand?

12:30.156 --> 12:35.063
Your father disfigured his own automobile just so he could stay here and drive me crazy.

12:35.303 --> 12:38.568
Oh, Peggy, the poor guy just wants to spend time with us.

12:38.988 --> 12:42.193
And you've made it so hard for him, he's afraid to ask.

12:42.173 --> 12:42.734
You're right.

12:43.154 --> 12:43.794
It's my fault.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.917
Why didn't I serve that poor man his sausage?

12:47.298 --> 12:48.459
What's the point in arguing?

12:48.699 --> 12:50.200
The car is fixed now.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.641
He'll be out of here tonight.

12:52.282 --> 12:55.485
Aunt Peg, I found this timing belt in the laundry.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.347
You want me to wash it with the darks?

12:58.668 --> 12:59.809
Good morning, angels.

13:00.389 --> 13:02.351
Do I have an assignment for you?

13:02.892 --> 13:03.892
Good morning, Charlie.

13:04.213 --> 13:05.774
Ah, damn!

13:06.495 --> 13:08.176
It's a Shelley hack!

13:08.196 --> 13:10.138
That's like getting a shimp.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.205
What in the hell is going on here?

13:12.726 --> 13:14.229
Where are your pants?

13:14.249 --> 13:15.111
We were hot.

13:15.131 --> 13:15.712
Take them off.

13:15.992 --> 13:19.378
A man doesn't have to wear pants around the house if he doesn't want to.

13:19.759 --> 13:21.682
Yeah, what you got them blue jeans on for, Hank?

13:22.163 --> 13:22.604
Let's go.

13:22.644 --> 13:23.345
Take them off.

13:23.626 --> 13:24.908
I don't want to take them off.

13:25.329 --> 13:27.673
Buddy, take your daddy's pants off.

13:28.415 --> 13:29.717
Okie dokie cotton, Hank.

13:29.737 --> 13:30.398
Fix your car.

13:30.739 --> 13:32.703
I guess you'll be wanting to head back right about now.

13:33.063 --> 13:33.544
Peggy.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.078
Well, um, maybe we should think about getting back.

13:38.098 --> 13:38.859
Huh, honey?

13:38.879 --> 13:39.700
What did you say?

13:40.482 --> 13:41.343
What did you say?

13:41.363 --> 13:41.423
OK.

13:45.730 --> 13:47.012
Now, what did you say, baby kinks?

13:47.372 --> 13:48.273
We can leave.

13:48.354 --> 13:50.497
Hank fixed the car.

13:51.078 --> 13:52.340
Actually, Luann fixed it.

13:53.001 --> 13:57.688
Oh, that's a good one, Hank's wife.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.831
A woman fixing a car.

14:00.191 --> 14:02.535
That's like a pig trying to read.

14:03.511 --> 14:03.892
Yeah.

14:05.475 --> 14:08.020
Well, I guess you can go home now, Dad.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.385
Now, I don't think so.

14:10.405 --> 14:12.429
We're gonna stick around a few more days.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.172
Supper time, Colonel.

14:15.816 --> 14:18.060
You've forgotten my beer!

14:18.142 --> 14:20.524
Come on, get me my beer, woman.

14:21.405 --> 14:24.228
Mom, I'll take my dinner in here, too.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.289
Bobby, you will not.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.091
We eat our dinner in the kitchen.

14:27.512 --> 14:28.873
Boy wants his dinner in here.

14:29.093 --> 14:31.215
Well, we eat in the kitchen.

14:31.516 --> 14:31.756
Here.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.356
Kitchen.

14:32.457 --> 14:32.757
Here.

14:32.897 --> 14:33.257
Kitchen.

14:33.277 --> 14:33.618
Here.

14:33.798 --> 14:35.800
I forgot, psych, I need a little support here.

14:36.801 --> 14:44.269
Well, Peggy, it might be nice for a change to have dinner in front of the TV.

14:44.689 --> 14:47.592
Well, go on, woman, get me my dinner.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.103
I don't know where you got the idea.

14:52.163 --> 14:53.945
You could slap your mother's behind.

14:53.985 --> 14:56.810
I'll tell you where he got the idea.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.012
Your father.

14:58.412 --> 15:00.776
And it's all your fault for not nipping it in the bud.

15:00.996 --> 15:01.937
What do you want me to do?

15:01.958 --> 15:03.340
I can't change my father.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.583
Well, he certainly won't listen to me now, will he?

15:06.164 --> 15:07.105
You're both men.

15:07.286 --> 15:09.068
You're both peacocks, remember?

15:09.249 --> 15:11.612
What are you turning into some kind of feminist?

15:12.113 --> 15:14.136
I am not a feminist, Hank.

15:14.116 --> 15:17.821
I am Peggy Hill, a citizen of the Republic of Texas.

15:18.382 --> 15:23.710
I work hard, I sweat hard, and I love hard, and I gotta smell good and look pretty while I'm doing it.

15:24.071 --> 15:31.141
So I comb my hair, I reapply lipstick 30 times a day, I do your dishes, I wash your clothes, and I clean the house.

15:31.482 --> 15:38.492
Not because I have to, Hank, but because of a mutual unspoken agreement that I have never brought up because I am too much of a lady.

15:39.534 --> 15:41.136
30 times a day?

15:42.382 --> 15:43.646
Yeah, I'm kind of like it here.

15:44.007 --> 15:45.993
What kind of work can that guy get in this town?

15:46.535 --> 15:49.183
Uh, are you allergic to asbestos?

15:49.484 --> 15:50.026
Hello?

15:50.527 --> 15:51.089
Hey, Dad.

15:51.490 --> 15:53.657
Hey, if it ain't the ol' grease monkey!

15:53.924 --> 15:54.725
All right, Dad.

15:55.106 --> 15:58.572
I need to talk to you about some of the things you've been telling Bobby.

15:58.953 --> 16:00.536
I've been telling Bobby a lot of things.

16:00.636 --> 16:04.684
For example, I told him how I lost my shins defending our country.

16:05.004 --> 16:06.166
You want to hear that story, Fatty?

16:06.427 --> 16:07.268
Sure, yes, sir!

16:07.749 --> 16:10.073
Bill, I'm trying to talk to my... I was 14.

16:10.735 --> 16:11.997
Just a little older than Bobby.

16:12.518 --> 16:14.341
But I knew Uncle Sam needed me.

16:14.742 --> 16:17.046
So I lied and signed up.

16:18.106 --> 16:20.349
And we had beaten the Nazis in Italy.

16:20.369 --> 16:22.693
And they shipped us to the Pacific Theater.

16:23.334 --> 16:26.979
A Tojo torpedo sent our troops ship to the bottom.

16:26.999 --> 16:29.683
I could only save three of my buddies.

16:29.703 --> 16:32.166
Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn.

16:32.707 --> 16:35.271
They were kind of like you fellas, only one of them was from Brooklyn.

16:35.932 --> 16:40.418
Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero and put fifty bullets in my bow.

16:41.099 --> 16:42.261
The blood attracted sharks.

16:43.283 --> 16:46.307
I had to give them Fatty.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.442
Then things took a turn for the worse.

16:48.802 --> 16:49.824
I met it to an island.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.968
But it was full of tojos.

16:52.988 --> 16:55.391
They were spittin' on the US flag.

16:55.411 --> 16:56.913
So I rushed them.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.215
But it was a trap.

16:58.235 --> 17:02.601
They opened fire and blew my skin off.

17:02.621 --> 17:07.627
Last thing I remember, I beat them all to death with a big piece of fattie.

17:08.188 --> 17:12.674
I woke up in a field hospital, and they were sewing my feet to my knees.

17:14.316 --> 17:14.877
Now,

17:15.447 --> 17:18.210
What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Hank?

17:20.592 --> 17:23.094
Well, nothing, I guess.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.622
You've had enough cake, Connie.

17:32.263 --> 17:32.984
What are you doing?

17:33.564 --> 17:36.327
A man's gotta tell a woman when to stop eating.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.309
You're looking kind of chunky.

17:39.630 --> 17:40.811
Oh, she's moody.

17:41.192 --> 17:42.653
Must be PBS.

17:45.434 --> 17:46.115
Let's go.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.336
I gotta see a man about a horse.

17:49.217 --> 17:51.059
Bobby, don't forget to bust your tray.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.861
Ah, that's women's work.

17:53.881 --> 17:55.002
Ain't that right, fellas?

17:55.963 --> 17:56.924
Women's work!

17:57.684 --> 17:58.645
Women's work!

17:59.146 --> 18:00.447
Women's work!

18:00.467 --> 18:01.448
Women's work!

18:01.888 --> 18:02.929
Women's work!

18:05.291 --> 18:05.551
Women's work!

18:05.571 --> 18:05.831
Women's work!

18:05.851 --> 18:06.111
Women's work!

18:06.132 --> 18:06.392
Women's work!

18:06.412 --> 18:06.672
Women's work!

18:06.692 --> 18:06.972
Women's work!

18:09.134 --> 18:12.577
Well, she's got a point, but he's a war hero.

18:13.858 --> 18:15.019
She's my wife.

18:15.488 --> 18:17.290
But he's got no shins.

18:18.571 --> 18:21.235
Uh, I'm just trying to get a little propane here.

18:23.697 --> 18:24.658
Stricklin' propane.

18:24.939 --> 18:27.982
Bobby was sent home from school for starting a sexist riot today.

18:28.403 --> 18:28.663
What?

18:29.164 --> 18:30.805
I'm coming home right now.

18:31.106 --> 18:35.671
Well, you're just a little too late, because the devil took Bobby off to the Hotel Arlen.

18:35.831 --> 18:36.872
Hotel Arlen!

18:44.100 --> 18:44.601
Bobby!

18:45.290 --> 18:47.613
I'm proud of you for what you did at school today.

18:48.614 --> 18:50.036
So I'm buying you a hooker.

18:50.416 --> 18:52.278
Go ahead, pick yourself out alive way.

18:52.859 --> 18:54.201
Alive one what?

18:54.942 --> 18:57.084
Hey, cutie, you got papers?

19:01.810 --> 19:03.652
Bobby, get over here now.

19:04.493 --> 19:06.776
Grandpa said I could- Bobby, you heard your mother.

19:06.876 --> 19:07.557
Get over there.

19:08.658 --> 19:09.699
What are you saying, Hank?

19:10.320 --> 19:11.922
Are you siding with your woman?

19:12.408 --> 19:13.689
Look at me, son!

19:14.110 --> 19:15.591
Look at my shins!

19:16.352 --> 19:21.437
Look, Dad, I'm sorry about fatty and your shins, but I'm not a kid anymore.

19:21.958 --> 19:27.063
Bobby is my boy, and I won't let him grow up to be a woman hating old fool.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.865
No wonder Mom left you.

19:29.185 --> 19:32.729
She was a strong lady, classy and smart like Peg.

19:33.149 --> 19:35.171
Maybe you couldn't handle that, but I can.

19:35.732 --> 19:38.635
My marriage is a partnership of equals.

19:38.615 --> 19:47.667
Peggy might do all the housework, but there are a lot of other things that I'm supposed to do, but I'm not going to say what they are because I'm a gentleman.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.268
Oh, I get it.

19:48.969 --> 19:50.171
She's making you say this.

19:50.791 --> 19:51.953
You're just her puppet.

19:52.253 --> 19:54.697
No, Dad, I'm saying all this because I mean it.

19:55.137 --> 19:56.459
Now, Dee Dee's out in the car.

19:56.539 --> 19:57.440
I had her pack up.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.002
It's time for you to head home.

20:00.204 --> 20:06.833
Well, I never thought I'd see the day when my own son would stop loving me.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.378
It's about time!

20:16.059 --> 20:17.420
Love for sissies!

20:18.041 --> 20:23.167
Ain't that right, ya house full of hookers?

20:23.187 --> 20:24.829
All right, hookers, listen up.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.214
I'll be back next year so don't be jacking up your prices.

20:28.955 --> 20:31.618
I'll be staying over to Hank Hill's home.

20:34.041 --> 20:37.906
Bobby, you gotta try and forget all that gobbledygook your grandpa told ya.

20:38.506 --> 20:40.549
You listen to your mother, she knows best.

20:40.664 --> 20:41.725
But she's a woman.

20:41.785 --> 20:43.608
How could she know better than Grandpa?

20:43.868 --> 20:51.518
Well, because she's a lot smarter than him for one, your mother's probably got a better head on her shoulders than anybody in Ireland.

20:51.538 --> 20:54.723
Better than Bill, or Dale, or Boomerower?

20:55.063 --> 20:58.528
Geez, Bobby, why not compare it to a baboon in the zoo?

20:58.848 --> 21:00.951
But I thought they were your best friends.

21:01.032 --> 21:02.874
Peggy's my best friend, son.

21:03.414 --> 21:03.955
Mom?

21:04.335 --> 21:04.856
That's right.

21:05.457 --> 21:09.641
And when you're older, I hope you're lucky enough to find a girl to be best friends with, too.

21:10.422 --> 21:11.823
You think that'll really happen to me?

21:12.324 --> 21:15.747
Well, it won't if you keep slapping them in the butt and ordering them around.

21:16.208 --> 21:16.968
You'll do okay.

21:16.988 --> 21:18.770
You just have to remember one thing.

21:19.451 --> 21:22.514
Women were not put on this earth to serve you and me.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.437
Now, what do you say we get an ice cream?
