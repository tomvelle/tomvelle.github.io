I didn't get to bed until three this morning.
I was watching the Taxi Bear thought on Nick at night.
Thank you very much.
Bobby, in this house you don't get to sleep through your summer vacation and watch what were probably repeats all night like some shut-in.
Here, I've put together a chore list and I made sure to alternate between light and heavy chores.
Weed pulling is not a light chore.
Yes it is.
I just purchased a new weed puller.
Well, actually, I wouldn't mind trying that out first.
And, uh, don't worry about the garage door.
I'll paint that this weekend and... Huh.
I'm not giving you my chores.
You're getting a job.
Okay.
Though I'm not very employable.
No skills, bad attitude, seventh grade education, but we can try.
Hello, Peggy here.
Oh, well, men, I'm surprised to see you here.
I've been donating blood for a long time.
I'm what they call a universal donor type O. I can give blood to anyone.
My blood, that important.
Well, I am AB negative, the rarest blood of all.
Liquid gold!
Mrs. Hill, our records show that you have donated a total of six pints of blood.
I want you to know that when you've reached eight pints... Or one gallon.
Uh, yes, or one gallon.
We will give you a complimentary coffee mug.
A mug?
And, and it would say that I gave blood, right?
Yes.
And Mrs. Susan is some bone.
You're only one pint away from the mug.
Hear that, Piggy Hill?
Next time I'll be drinking orange juice from a coffee mug while you're still drinking it from the little itty-bitty Piggy Hill paper cup.
Dealing Cupnic Air Tank?
Oh, good one.
Mr. Strickland, I was wondering if it'd be okay to put Bobby to work for the summer as a tank wipe.
No, it's too late.
I promised the last tank wipe job to Ms.
Liz's brother's stepson's kid.
I tell you what, if Bobby works half as hard as you, I'll pull a few strings, grease a few palms, get him a job as a caddy at the golf club.
Well, that would be great, sir.
Hey, you know, I love golf.
Maybe if, uh, you know, sometime... I mean, I know you love golf, too, and I thought... No, Hank, you too old me, caddy.
Get back to work.
Well, hey, man.
I just thought you'd like to know that I donated another pint of blood.
Seven pints of peace, man, but not for long.
I am on a donating streak.
It's a trick to be picked by goffers to make sure you make eye contact.
Look alert, they like that.
If you don't get picked, you end up sitting on your butt all day.
Thanks for the tip.
Yeah, let me see, uh... Hey, Mr. Franklin.
Nice to see you, sir.
Here you go, Bradley.
Hey, you, bring me a martini on the first tee.
Two olives.
Hey, Bobby, how to treat you?
Good, sir.
Well, now you can tell them buck stricklin' treats you better.
Hey, after work, we're going to hang out and wash some golf carts.
Then we're going to ride some blocks of ice down the hill.
Well, I'm not really interested in washing carts, but do give me a shout when you're ready to do that ice riding thing.
Okay, you wanna go first?
Me?
Sure.
What the heck?
Now how do I... You are ice blackin', my friend!
Yeah!
Do you know who you knocked down?
The chairman of the membership committee.
Yeah, that's right.
Corky Raywood.
Oh, I'd be wedding myself too right now if I were you.
Sir, your son was involved in an incident near Green Number Six.
A club member was incapacitated due to ice blocking.
Your son's services as a caddy have been terminated.
Oh, God, Bobby.
Mr. Strickland is my boss.
He put his reputation on the line to get you this job.
Also, sir, your truck is parked more than one foot from the curb.
I'm giving you a warning.
You're not a cop.
That's why it's just a warning.
Corky Raywood may have a deep thigh bruise, but the real victim here is Mr. Strickland.
You owe that man an apology.
I'll wait out here.
I'm really sorry, sir.
I don't know if you've ever ridden a block of ice before.
Well, I married Miss Liz, didn't I?
Don't you worry, Bobby.
I'll take care of this.
But that security guy said I was fired.
Then that security guard's fired.
Oh, no, please don't.
Two ladies fired.
Oh, sorry, Bobby.
I was making a hot toddy for you showed up.
You want a hot toddy?
Hot toddy will calm your nerves.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Middleies!
Two hot toddies!
We're gonna toast your new job as my personal caddy.
Now tell me, Bobby, you really not got some bitch on his ass?
You know he tried to get me kicked out of the club to throw my putt at his wife?
No one sneezes when Buck Strickland's about to putt.
Except for Buck Strickland.
I'm gonna make you my personal catty.
Oh, gee, thank you for doing this for me, sir.
Not done it for you, I'm doing it for Bobby.
He reminds me of my boy.
I didn't know you had a son.
Yeah, I lived in a different town, different woman.
Name's Roy Ray, something like that.
After 16 years, I'm too embarrassed to ask.
18 holes.
I've never walked that far in my life.
Well, you're not gonna start now.
Toss those clubs in the cart and take the driving seat.
You hungry, Bobby?
Yes, sir, I am.
I'll have a couple of hot dogs with everything on them, Sam.
Fantastic!
Damn it!
Woo-hoo-hoo!
You playing army golf today, bogus?
Army golf?
Yeah, left, right, left, right.
Good one, sir.
Yeah!
Woo!
Sit that whole home in a taxi!
I had a dream last night where we were all naked, except for you, Hank.
You had these tiny, clear plastic underpants on.
Actually, they weren't doing you any good, really, because you could see everything, but the weird part is... Look, look, there's Bobby.
See you tomorrow at the club, Bobby.
He didn't ask Mr. Strickland to give your eye at home, did you?
He insisted, and he tipped me a dead president.
Hamilton!
Way to go, Bobby.
Mr. Strickland's not one to throw his money around.
He rewards hard work with a fair salary.
Look at you, Hank.
You are so jealous.
When was the last time you were dropped off at home by your boss?
Never.
So then, when Buck finally sunk his butt, he tried to do a little dance, but he's kinda too big, so he had me do it for him.
Everybody loved it!
Well, while Buck's out enjoying himself on the links, I'm just glad he's got someone like me at the shop to keep the trains running on time.
Take today, for instance.
We got a surprise call from the Propane Association.
They needed to talk to Buck.
Well, I handled it.
Told him, that would be fine.
Yep, that's just the kind of fires I have to put out when Buck's not around.
Huh.
Anyway, it was some game.
Mr. Strickland got up under more balls than a midget hooker.
Bobby!
Where did you learn language like that?
The television?
No, Mr. Strickland.
Just because you're his caddy does not give you the right to repeat it.
Take it easy, old top.
God dang it, it's 7.15.
I'm missing the wheel.
Uh, sir, last night at dinner, Bobby used some language at... Oh, sorry, I didn't... Yeah, look, I gotta go.
Your daddy just walked in the room.
Hank, you want to say hi to your son?
Uh, no, but I'm glad I can talk to you both.
Mr. Strickland, Bobby used some language last night that he said he got from you.
Is that true, Bobby?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
All right then, Bobby.
I'll see you at the club.
Daddy'd heck.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to send you home.
Your blood pressure is way too low.
Oh, dar, no mug for men.
Did you give blood recently?
Yes.
But so did she, twice.
See?
You do not have to take it from a vein in my arm.
You can take it from one in the back of my leg.
Both of you go home.
And I'm not giving you a mug.
You can have a cookie.
I do not want a cookie.
I want that mug.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Let's save some lives.
Yeah, you ready to lose, Bradley?
No!
Look out!
Ah, shoot.
Now where'd that little something gun get to?
It's over here, Mr. Strickland.
No.
Ooh, what you holding?
Whoo, I almost broke my neck tripping over that ball.
Well, isn't that cheating, Mr. Strickland?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bobby.
No, it's just being clumsy.
There's no law against being clumsy.
That is, unless you caught.
Oh, no.
Go find the ball, Bobby.
Find it someplace good.
So Bobby, I thought that maybe we'd go golfing tomorrow.
Just the two of us.
Give your mother a chance to recuperate.
I can't add.
Buck asked me to catty for him this weekend.
And we are teeing off at nine tomorrow.
Isn't that Mr. Strickland's watch?
It's my watch now.
He gave it to me as a gift.
Buck Strickland does not give gifts.
I've worked for the man over fifteen years and he's never given me anything.
That's true, Bobby.
Never has.
Mr. Strickland probably just lent it to you.
No, he gave it to me for helping him get the best score of his life.
Huh, what'd he shoot?
A 65.
What?
That's a course record.
He was having some trouble, but I bailed him out with my trusty hand wedge.
Bobby, you cheated.
There was money on the game, besides Link Pratley's a horse's ass.
You're giving that watch back.
No, I'm not.
Mr. Strickland gave me that watch, and it's Mr. Strickland who gives me my money.
He asked me to jump, and I say, how high?
He asked me to cheat, and we're on the green in two.
Well, there is no getting around the rules in this house.
If you like cheating and lying so much, why don't you go to Buck's house?
All right, maybe I will.
Fine, I'll drive you.
Hank, what are you doing?
I know what I'm doing.
Well, it sounds like you know what you're doing, but I am still too lightheaded to really fully comprehend your plan.
No babysitter, he'll turn Bobby away the minute he sets foot on his doorstep.
All right, I can't handle a thousand details, Hank.
Just give me the broad strokes.
Hey!
Did Bobby phone home yet?
Where is Bobby?
Well, he's still at Bucks, but believe me, after a couple of hours without his night light and humidifier, he'll be begging to come home.
Oh, hello, Lupino.
Sorry to disturb you.
I need to talk to Mr. Strickland.
Mr. Strickland went to Hot Springs, Arkansas.
I pressed his gambling suit and I packed his naked lady playing cards.
He goes last night with Mr. Hill.
I'm Mr. Hill.
Little, Mr. Hill.
Oh, dang it.
All right.
If Mr. Strickland calls, you tell him, I'm taking a personal day.
You ever been to the dog races, Bobby?
Not one as organized as this.
Do they still let the monkeys ride the dogs around the track?
No, not since the 40s.
Nothing like seeing a monkey whip a dog down the back stretch.
Bobby, you gonna be my wallet caddy.
Now, don't lose it.
I got all my betting money in there.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, I just put our money on Wonder Dog.
I like that name.
Yeah, I saw Wonder Dog dump a load before the race.
Means he'll run light.
Look out, folks.
Here comes the money.
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog!
Look out, Wonder Dog
Oh, yeah.
That's not real.
You made that yourself.
They wouldn't take any more blood from you.
Well, maybe not in Arlen.
Maybe not in McMainerbury.
But then there's a little town called Houston.
And when that construction crane fell over, they didn't have time to ask questions.
You're lying.
I would not be down here gloating if I were.
I think I'll go inside and brew some coffee.
Yep, that's gonna taste sweet.
Now you see, your daddy wouldn't know how to have a good time like this.
No sir, he would not.
Hey old timer, you know where Rooster's Crap Game is tonight?
Rooster's crap game is between 4th and 5th Street.
Go run back.
Knock twice and slip a 20 under the door.
You ever see someone fish for $40, Bobby?
No.
Watch this.
Look at him go.
He makes it in a year when I make it a week.
Thanks for letting me know that my tail light was out.
Well, I'd want you to do the same for me, officer.
Say, can you tell me how much further it is to Hot Springs?
Another hour and a half.
All right.
Drive carefully now.
I will.
Kid can't come in.
No, it's okay.
He's my son.
I don't care who son it is.
Kid can't come in.
All right.
Bobby, you're going to have to stay out here.
I'm going to take half my betting money.
You hold on to the rest.
Yes, hold on to my heart pills.
If I'm losing my certain there, I'm going to fake a heart attack.
Now that's your cue to come in, waving the pills, screaming.
My daddy's having a heart attack.
My daddy's having a heart attack.
Got that.
No, it's my wallet, Caddy.
I am.
There we go.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Come on, baby.
Forget about him.
You're lucky my woman doesn't want me to fight you, little freak, or I'd mess you up good.
Ah!
I am hot, Bobby!
I just hit the five three times in a row!
You think I should press the five?
I don't know!
Mr. Strickland, how much longer do you... Not through it, I'm gonna press the five!
Lucks with me tonight, Bobby, I'm on a gravy train with biscuit wheels!
You all emptied out, Carla?
Yeah.
Oh, God!
Okay, kid.
Hand over the money.
My daddy's having a heart attack.
My daddy's having a heart attack.
Your daddy already tried that.
We're not buying it.
Now give us the money.
And the watch.
But the watch is mine.
Your daddy said you'd give us the money and the watch.
Now come on, kid, the watch.
The watch is mine!
You get what you needed, Rooster!
That boy gave you the money and the watch!
The boy gave us the money.
Took off with the watch.
What?
God dang it, Bobby!
I think I'm having an infarction!
Look through his pockets and take his shoes.
It's my watch.
Back off.
I'm this boy's father.
I thought the old guy was his father.
No, no, no.
This one's my dad.
This one right here.
The one with the golf club.
Here.
Take the watch.
I don't want it anymore.
The quicker we're out of hot springs, the better.
Oh, wow.
No, keep your distance.
I just need some air.
You hurt me.
I'm having a gut-dang heart attack.
Mr. Strickland, get in.
Get him.
What are you waiting for?
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Yeah!
Come and get me some of the bitches.
Yeah, that's right, ya!
Backwater Hicks, ya miss book again!
So, I guess I'm gonna be punished.
You're darn right.
First of all, you will not be catting for Mr. Strickland anymore.
Second of all, you're grounded for the rest of the summer.
Thanks, Dad.
you
Too hot that is!
