They can make a saw that doesn't cut skin, but they can't make a parachute that opens.
Can we move this along?
I have a full day ahead of me.
Boggle with Nancy at 2, softball practice at 4, and at some point I should probably take a shower.
Now Peggy, don't expect to be 100% right away.
It is likely your muscles have atrophied.
Well, what you may not know, Doctor, is that every morning since the accident, I have been doing isometric butt clenches.
No, no, no.
Thank you, doctor.
I will take over from here.
Oh!
Well, what do you know?
It doesn't smell in here at all.
Oh, come on, Peggy.
You'll be back on your feet in no time.
Stop moping.
I am not moping.
I am having trouble supporting my head.
Peggy Hill.
Alright.
My name's Ramsay.
I'm your physical therapist and I'm gonna have you walking again in no time.
You will?
Sure.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.
In a month?
Way too soon.
Don't be so tough on yourself.
Nobody spends six weeks in a cast without their body going a little soft.
But that's okay.
Water's soft too, but give it time and it'll carve a grand canyon.
Now that didn't take a day, a week, or even a month.
It took over 200 years.
The Grand Canyon took millions of years.
You gotta learn to trust me, Mrs. Hill.
We're gonna be working together one hour at a time, once a week, for however long it takes to carve you a Grand Canyon.
We're gonna do this drop by drop.
Are you with me?
Well, alright, I guess so.
Okay, let's do it.
Great.
See you next week.
Next week?
Drop by drop, Mrs. Flores.
Yeah, you got it.
Now I am moping.
No peeking.
I'm not peeking.
Okay, you can open your eyes.
Okay, they're open.
Luanne.
Oh.
Ta-da!
Remember the ten bags of cement you said I'd never use?
Well, I used one.
Oh, a wheelchair ramp.
Well, I thank you.
Now I don't have to be trapped in the house, huh?
I can go anywhere.
In my wheelchair.
Thank you.
Look dad, I'm so feelin' her in, huh?
Bobby, I'm driving you to school today.
We need to talk.
Oh, I'm late for parenting class.
Luanne, could you give me a ride and help me find the baby?
I sure am glad you're out of that body cast, Peggy.
Well, thank you, Bill.
What do you suppose they do with something like that?
Throw it out, I imagine.
Huh.
Aw.
Oh
Ain't you gonna eat your waffle, hank's wife?
It's right in front of you.
Reach for it.
Come on!
You wouldn't last a day in a Japanese POW camp.
Excuse me?
Told Joe had me cooped up in a bamboo wreck cage.
There was nothing to eat except rats.
So that's what I ate.
After two weeks I was down to my last rat.
I let him live so I could eat his droppings.
Called it jungle rice.
Tasted fine.
By September, I was finally thin enough to slip between the bamboo bars of my cage.
I strangled the guard with a rope made of braided rat tails and ran to safety.
Oh, thank God.
Well, that's my ride to rehab.
To be continued.
I can't.
That's okay.
I can't.
High five, drop.
I can't.
That's alright.
Oh!
Great set!
You showed that rubber bandit was boss.
But you told me to do 8 to 12 reps.
I maybe did a 0 to 1 reps.
If you count that last one.
Every drop counts, Mrs. Hill.
You're wearing down the rock.
And by the way, I checked.
We were both right.
It was 200 million years.
So, how was rehab?
I stretched a rubber band today.
Hey, that's great.
Oh, who am I kidding?
That rubber band kicked my ass.
Look, I know you're disappointed.
You just got to take it one day at a time, like the drunks do.
Hank, I just want to go to sleep.
Fetal position, please.
Oh, yeah!
What?
I just, I don't, that's why, Dale, I just get so lonely and we both like playing boggle.
Of course she always wins, don't you see?
Please don't tell Hank.
I want her for the carpool lane.
Okay.
That's what they've been teaching you in rehab, hank's wife?
Okay, Cotton, you have had your fun.
Now, why don't you help me into my chair?
Why don't you help yourself?
Well, I am trying.
Don't you think I am trying?
I can't.
Because you're weak.
You ain't got the guts.
You don't deserve to walk again.
Peggy Hill.
She'll be right there.
You want to waste your time in rehab?
Getting your chair and go.
You sadistic son of a- What are you on your knees for, woman?
Praying ain't gonna help.
If God loved you, he'd have opened your sissy chute.
You shut up, you- Oh yeah!
Teach me to walk.
You ready to hate me more than you ever hated anyone in your life?
I already do.
Then we're halfway there.
Don't you wipe on me?
Don't look away!
Sitting there all high and mighty in your wheelchair like you're some Franklin D. Eleanor Roosevelt.
Well, I've got that telegram for you.
You're no FDR.
Stop.
You're wasting my time.
Stop.
I'm not even sure you want to walk.
Well, Cotton, of course I do.
And tell me you want to walk.
I want to walk.
I can't whoo-hoo.
I want to walk.
What's that?
I want to walk!
Good.
Now, sign the boots and make them all sparkly.
I'm gonna be buried in those nasty stompers at the Texas State Cemetery.
That's where our government inters its war heroes.
Inters means buried.
War heroes means me.
They're letting you in there?
Well, first I gots to die.
But before that, I gots to
fill out an application and be approved by a damn commission.
I killed 50 men and now I gotta go begging for a war hero's grave.
It ain't right.
My arms are tired.
And I was tired too when I was ordered to retake Blunder Airfield in the Solomon Islands.
But I retook it anyway.
So Joe had a machine gun nest high up on a hill.
Had my whole unit pinned down.
So I snuck myself behind the enemy lines in a fifty-five gallon drum of sucking.
Held my breath till they got good and drunk.
And then I jumped out, spitting out the hall into my soap.
Yep, I bought you the whole squad.
Come on, lady, make them shine.
Well, you just shaved two minutes off my commute.
Thanks, Peggy.
Ah!
Please don't tell Hank.
Disrespectful.
Talking about it, I just like to build those trees, man.
I'm not angry, man.
It's very damn disappointed, man.
Very.
Many times over, Hank's wife.
Oh, now look what you've done.
He's crying.
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c
Wow!
1944!
I crawled through a minefield to retrieve General MacArthur's corn cow pipe!
That's right, I'm a hero!
They're gonna bury me in the Texas State Cemetery!
You?
You're a coward!
They'll bury you up on Coward's Hill!
I am not a coward!
What are you doing, swatting flies?
We're just waving along.
Well, hello to you too, you fly swatting loser.
Now move it.
Colonel, I think the baby's crying.
Good job.
Those parroting classes are starting to pay off.
Thank you.
Well, I don't mean to brag about the stakes here, but, uh, Dad, you can take out your teeth.
Shouldn't we wait for Aunt Peggy to get back from rehab?
Oh my god.
Was it my turn to pick her up?
Oh, she quit the rehab.
She what?
Yep.
I'm in charge now.
She's making good progress.
Don't need her wheelchair no more.
Oh my god, Peggy.
What have you done to my wife?
Turn her into a highly trained, highly motivated fighting machine.
This is crazy, Dad.
You're not a medical professional.
First thing tomorrow, we're going back to rehab.
Is that what you want?
You want to drop out of the program?
Sir, no, sir!
Good effort.
Have some chow.
Hank, the steak is so tender.
Had to get you out of that house.
Nothing there but girls and babies.
I'm referring to your husband.
That's why I brought you here.
Meet the greatest collection of soldiers this country has ever known.
Stinky, Fatty, Stinky, Brooklyn, Stinky, Brooklyn, Fatty, Fatty, and Doc.
Oh, and Erwin Linker.
Many fought and died for the flag, and now we're giving you the honor of racing it.
Show us how a real hero starts his day.
Well, how many boots did you shine?
Your arms are still flabby.
You done left old Gloria to half-bast.
Well, who died?
Is it you?
Are you dying on me?
Go ahead.
Because you don't deserve to live, you worthless... Well, how do you know?
That gal might have what it takes after all.
Now raise that flag.
Peggy, I'm setting the alarm for seven.
Dang it.
Yup.
Set it for five-thirty.
Cotton wants me to cut back on my sleep.
Says it's making me soft.
Uh, Peggy, you remember how you've always hated my father?
Well, I never wanted to say anything because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but uh...
I think my dad is not too fond of you, either, pretty much.
Uh, I'm just afraid he's taken advantage of your condition to, uh, well, I don't know, torture you or something?
Hank, he's not torturing me.
The man is inspiring me.
And with his help, Peggy Hill is doing things I could never have done on her own.
That's why I'm helping him with his application.
Did he ever tell you how he survived eight days in a life raft by trapping rainwater in his upturned eyelids?
Yeah, he might have mentioned that once or twice.
May 2nd, 45.
During the battle for Okinawa, Cotton invented a bayonet technique that is still used to gut men today.
April 30th, 45 at the occupation of Munich.
So hold on a minute.
Munich, Germany?
Yes, Hank.
Well, how did my dad fight in Germany and Japan at the same time?
Well, let's see.
April 30th?
May 2nd?
That's two whole days.
How long does it take to kill 50 men?
Well, let's get to work.
Come on, grab some flour.
Hold on, Cotton.
I have a few questions.
You don't ask me questions.
Ah, yes, the questions are right here.
Like, move it, move it, move it.
What's wrong with you?
You crawled yesterday?
Now come at me.
Like on Okinawa when the Tojo's came at me faster than I could get them, so I had to get them faster.
You were never on Okinawa.
Yes, I was.
Then you were never in Munich.
Yes, I was.
More than Hank.
Scrambled.
Black.
Sports page.
You got five minutes.
Oh, God.
It was all lies.
Why did I ever believe him?
Why did I ever think that I could walk?
Don't talk like that, Peggy.
So I was right.
That's not important now.
What is important is that you get right back up on that horse.
There you go.
Pass me Cotton's application.
He may rot in hell, but he will not rot in the Texas State Cemetery.
Tunnel, from your dressing demeanor, can I assume you are about to take your own life in a cheap motel room with your service revolver?
No cigar, Grimble.
I'm headed over to the Texas State Cemetery.
You can't wear that to my hearing!
Don't worry, Cotton.
I won't.
Yeah, good.
Go change and meet me there.
And show some leg.
Ain't got much tone, but games is games.
Let's go, Hank.
I just talked to Ramsay.
He said he'll take you back, but he's gotta warn ya.
Mrs. Flores is already combing her own hair, so don't get jealous.
Who's ready for a sponge bath?
Yo.
Let's see.
Bicep curls.
Where do we leave our five pounds?
I'd like the half-pounders, please.
Okay.
Let's get busy.
Just kidding.
Let's take it slow.
For your portrayal of Dr. Jerry Kenderson on TV's Dallas, 1984 to 1986, we proudly assign you Barry Jenner, cemetery platform, Section K. Oh!
Thank you.
Oh, they're gonna run out of graves.
That concludes today's business.
The Texas State Cemetery Commission will reconvene in six months.
Oh, no!
You fellas got one more man to bury.
All right, pass up the application.
Oh, I don't have it on me at the moment.
It's being crippled over.
Give me another minute, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
No, no, no!
Not the gavel!
Don't bang the... Ugh!
Let it go!
Meeting is not adjourned.
Play to go, Peggy.
You're doing just great.
Would you please stop yelling at me?
What was I thinking?
Munich?
Rat tails?
He's no hero.
He was just torturing me.
He is a complete fraud.
What?
What are you muttering?
Are you actually trying to defend him?
I said that fraud used to be six foot four.
So?
When he came back from the Pacific, he was five foot even.
A Japanese machine gun blew away his shins.
The doctor said he'd never walk again.
18 months later, he walked right over to that doctor, reached up, and punched him in the kidneys.
Now, I can't prove what he did at those battles.
In fact, I don't even know if the part about hitting the doctor is true, but I do know that my dad doesn't have shins.
And somehow, he walks.
And that's pretty heroic to me.
And that is what I was muttering.
I'm an old man.
I got a newborn son.
I can't let him visit me at a civilian cemetery.
What kind of a place is that for a child's birthday party?
Mr. Chairman, the chair recognizes Mrs. Peggy Hill.
In deference to the committee's busy schedule, I have chosen to highlight only a few of Cotton Hill's many acts of bravery at Guam, the Solomon Islands, Sardinia, and Okinawa.
Manger woman, you forgot Munich.
You were never in Munich.
I wasn't?
No.
Dad, Steven Austin.
Is that the bionic guy or the wrestler?
I found it!
It's a lovely grave, Cotton.
You deserve it.
Ain't you coming, Hanks Rife?
That's okay.
I can see it from here.
Not the same.
Out of the chair.
Let's go.
Start climbing.
But I... I can't.
What do you mean you can't?
You mean you won't?
Because you're weak and lazy.
Cotton, please?
I climbed the cliffs of Normandy with a 50-pound ice cream maker stripped to my back.
And you're telling me you can't climb a stupid little hill?
All right, Cotton.
Look, I know what you're doing, but I am very tired.
You get to the top of that hill and I'll let you dance on my grave.
Let's go!
Move it!
Move it!
Come on!
Come on!
Cotton, may I have this dance?
I can't hear you!
