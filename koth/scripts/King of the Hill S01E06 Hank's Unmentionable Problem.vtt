WEBVTT

00:37.628 --> 00:39.110
How was beauty school, Luanne?

00:39.891 --> 00:41.953
Oh, how did the big shampooing final go?

00:41.993 --> 00:50.383
Well, I passed the lather, but I failed rinse, and then I failed repeat, too, because it includes rinse, which I don't think is very fair.

00:50.423 --> 00:57.031
Um, Hank, you forgot to flush.

00:57.471 --> 00:58.132
Didn't have to.

00:58.452 --> 00:59.293
Didn't do anything.

01:00.355 --> 01:00.455
Oh.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.298
I see.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.352
How long has this been going on?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.857
There's nothing going on, Peg.

01:08.578 --> 01:09.480
That's the problem.

01:10.001 --> 01:11.524
Well, how long have you had this problem?

01:11.685 --> 01:13.508
There is no problem, please.

01:13.669 --> 01:15.873
This is not something we need to talk about.

01:16.735 --> 01:20.322
Well, if you do have a problem, I could... Peggy, please, for God's sakes.

01:21.304 --> 01:22.045
I'm getting a bite.

01:22.687 --> 01:24.831
Is there any chicken fried steak left?

01:34.953 --> 01:39.860
Here.

01:40.421 --> 01:41.022
What's this?

01:41.302 --> 01:42.263
It's megamucil.

01:42.544 --> 01:46.429
I take 10 heaping teaspoons in a glass of water every night to stay regular like that.

01:46.449 --> 01:47.491
I don't want to know that.

01:47.731 --> 01:48.752
Oh, come on, honey.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.136
Look, it is gentle and all-natural.

01:51.196 --> 01:52.137
No, no, no.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.179
Stop, please.

01:53.699 --> 01:56.964
This is my own private, personal, private business.

01:57.144 --> 01:58.145
At least drink the water.

01:58.446 --> 02:01.991
If you drink enough water, it'll flush out your sister's teeth, please.

02:02.011 --> 02:04.234
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.363
Hey, ancient sausage.

02:06.403 --> 02:07.105
That looks good.

02:07.726 --> 02:08.807
Peggy, where's my breakfast?

02:12.354 --> 02:13.015
What are these?

02:13.876 --> 02:15.439
I baked muffins.

02:15.860 --> 02:16.861
So good for you.

02:16.901 --> 02:18.023
Where's my sausage?

02:18.444 --> 02:20.548
Well, we're out of sausage.

02:20.988 --> 02:21.770
Hey, try a muffin.

02:21.790 --> 02:22.791
They are oat brand.

02:23.493 --> 02:24.855
Uh, sure.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.132
You should eat those, Dad.

02:30.512 --> 02:32.074
They help you make.

02:32.094 --> 02:32.875
Excuse me?

02:32.895 --> 02:32.975
Huh?

02:34.137 --> 02:35.298
What are you implying?

02:35.618 --> 02:37.521
Well, I thought you were constant.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.163
Where would you get such an idea?

02:39.223 --> 02:40.044
That's ridiculous.

02:40.504 --> 02:43.548
Anyway, that's not something you should ever know about your father.

02:43.868 --> 02:45.590
Well, it's pretty obvious.

02:45.651 --> 02:47.813
You were in the bathroom for an hour last night.

02:47.913 --> 02:48.714
No, I wasn't.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.436
Okay, Dad.

02:51.297 --> 02:51.778
Give me that.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.525
What is it, Lady Bird?

02:58.653 --> 03:00.335
You wanna go out again?

03:00.375 --> 03:09.184
Show off.

03:09.204 --> 03:11.106
Oh Nancy, I'm worried about Hank.

03:11.546 --> 03:15.150
He hasn't done his business in four days.

03:16.131 --> 03:19.114
Good lord, poor Hank.

03:19.134 --> 03:20.235
He looks so healthy.

03:21.516 --> 03:23.358
But then, you know, so did Elvis Presley.

03:23.559 --> 03:24.019
Nancy.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.296
You don't think it's something serious?

03:26.517 --> 03:29.884
Well, I'm a meteorologist, not a doctor.

03:30.265 --> 03:34.495
But if I had to make an educated guess, I'd say he's got polio.

03:35.978 --> 03:36.740
Oh, all right.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.083
I'm not a meteorologist.

03:38.163 --> 03:39.105
I'm a weather girl.

03:39.676 --> 03:42.824
So Hank, what's this I hear about you being backed up?

03:43.245 --> 03:43.626
Nothing.

03:43.727 --> 03:44.148
What?

03:44.569 --> 03:46.694
Who are you thinking about talking to?

03:46.755 --> 03:47.456
It's not me.

03:47.617 --> 03:48.359
I'm fine.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.063
Well, that's not what I heard.

03:50.384 --> 03:51.326
Heard from who?

03:51.487 --> 03:51.888
Dale.

03:52.329 --> 03:53.472
How does Dale know?

03:53.673 --> 03:54.234
Nancy.

03:54.515 --> 03:56.520
Nancy knows too?

03:56.585 --> 03:57.386
Who?

03:57.406 --> 03:58.147
That Peggy.

03:58.747 --> 04:02.151
Why not just take the door off the bathroom and put it out on the lawn?

04:02.391 --> 04:05.314
Oh Hank, it happens to everyone now and then.

04:05.374 --> 04:07.797
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

04:07.977 --> 04:10.580
Maybe I'm not the one who should be embarrassed.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.701
Did you ever think of that?

04:12.262 --> 04:14.124
Maybe you're going a little too much.

04:14.885 --> 04:18.468
Once every four or five days gives me more free time.

04:19.089 --> 04:22.693
You want to spend all your time on the toilet, be my guest.

04:22.673 --> 04:24.115
Have you tried squatting?

04:24.516 --> 04:26.459
It takes pressure off the lower body.

04:27.020 --> 04:31.127
You know, Hank, I find a ride on the lawnmower helps.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.691
Would you please stop talking about this?

04:34.612 --> 04:34.893
Hey, Hank.

04:35.393 --> 04:39.360
You know, I've been thinking about y'all and y'all dang old bottom and all what's gonna get moving again.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.663
I think y'all ought to go jogging and swim in the water buns, man.

04:41.683 --> 04:43.967
They're gonna be bad having you pooping just like you used to, man.

04:44.027 --> 04:45.429
I know it's gonna work.

04:45.449 --> 04:47.372
It helped my aunt after her pregnancy.

04:47.893 --> 04:49.235
I don't know you, do I?

04:49.576 --> 04:50.217
No, you don't.

04:50.804 --> 04:53.007
Would you all please leave me be?

04:53.087 --> 04:55.330
This is no one's business but my own.

05:00.436 --> 05:03.861
Okay, but I've got one that's guaranteed to work for you Hank.

05:04.421 --> 05:07.205
You take a spoonful of bacon grease.

05:07.345 --> 05:08.947
I'm not eating bacon grease.

05:09.428 --> 05:11.310
You didn't let me finish.

05:12.202 --> 05:16.746
Simple chronic constipation can be a symptom of a more serious condition.

05:17.347 --> 05:17.927
I should know.

05:18.528 --> 05:21.110
I'm former Surgeon General C. Everett Coop.

05:21.130 --> 05:25.435
Why did you have to go tell Nancy about my bathroom shortcomings?

05:25.455 --> 05:30.339
Food that is not absorbed becomes waste and enters the pouch like sea cum.

05:30.559 --> 05:32.962
Who the hell is that, Howard Stern?

05:34.183 --> 05:38.547
Temperature is a pleasant 70 degrees and on a more personal note,

05:39.050 --> 05:43.857
I want to wish my friend Hank Hill a quick recovery for his embarrassing constipation.

05:44.318 --> 05:46.602
Oh, Peggy, why'd you do this to me?

05:46.662 --> 05:47.844
Now everybody knows.

05:48.144 --> 05:50.027
Oh, Hank, I was worried.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.870
So worried to yourself?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.653
Well, I'm tired of worrying to myself.

05:54.093 --> 05:55.896
It's better to talk things out, Hank.

05:55.916 --> 05:58.760
Not these things, not toilet things.

05:59.121 --> 05:59.782
All right, Hank.

06:00.443 --> 06:05.070
All right, if it makes you this upset, I will just sit here silently alone with my worries.

06:05.731 --> 06:06.272
Finally.

06:08.868 --> 06:17.565
Uh, I'll have some skirt steak, some brisket, a little piece of that New York steak, uh, a couple of them steak fingers and a burger.

06:17.686 --> 06:18.748
Oh, Hank, please.

06:18.768 --> 06:19.790
Have just one veggie.

06:20.030 --> 06:20.672
Oh, all right.

06:21.333 --> 06:30.692
Uh, put some macaroni and cheese on there, too.

06:30.712 --> 06:30.792
Mmm.

06:34.096 --> 06:35.698
Ooh, chocolate sauce.

06:35.858 --> 06:36.900
Can I have some?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.161
No, uh-uh, Bobby.

06:38.542 --> 06:39.903
This is an ordinary chocolate.

06:40.384 --> 06:42.026
It is laxative for your father.

06:43.708 --> 06:43.768
Oh.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.293
Where'd you find this chocolate sauce, Peg?

06:47.313 --> 06:48.134
It sure is good.

06:48.895 --> 06:50.036
Here, Bobby, try some.

06:50.357 --> 06:51.959
Okay, I thought you'd never ask.

06:52.319 --> 06:55.143
Bobby, Bobby, uh, you know what that is.

06:56.364 --> 06:56.685
So?

06:57.385 --> 06:57.846
What is it?

06:58.186 --> 06:59.428
Laxative.

07:00.657 --> 07:02.500
You're trying to drug me?

07:02.560 --> 07:05.023
Good God, that's going too far.

07:05.103 --> 07:06.625
Well, you won't talk to me about it.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.911
Now, what if it really is something serious, like polyps or worse?

07:11.272 --> 07:12.413
You should see a doctor.

07:13.354 --> 07:15.537
Stop making such a big deal out of it.

07:15.598 --> 07:17.600
I just can't go to the bathroom.

07:28.095 --> 07:30.478
Oh, my...

07:32.551 --> 07:34.533
He looks like an angel.

07:35.975 --> 07:40.119
A dead angel.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.583
It should have been Bill.

07:45.084 --> 07:48.948
Hank, we never got a chance to talk about your constipation.

07:49.189 --> 07:51.171
And now, we never will.

07:51.611 --> 07:54.314
Remember, early detection is the key.

07:55.055 --> 07:57.057
Now pass in your algebra homework.

08:02.858 --> 08:03.444
Goodbye, boy.

08:03.485 --> 08:06.456
See you in hell!

08:14.485 --> 08:15.586
Oh!

08:15.606 --> 08:16.287
Occupied!

08:16.347 --> 08:17.268
Hike!

08:17.949 --> 08:18.570
You're alive!

08:18.790 --> 08:20.192
Close the damn door!

08:20.272 --> 08:21.834
Can't you see I'm in here, Peg?

08:22.214 --> 08:23.676
No, don't touch me!

08:23.736 --> 08:24.617
I'm on the John!

08:24.737 --> 08:25.478
Get out of here!

08:25.538 --> 08:27.560
Hike, I was so scared!

08:28.041 --> 08:29.202
I dreamed you died!

08:29.482 --> 08:30.704
You didn't see a doctor!

08:30.964 --> 08:32.286
You didn't listen to Coop!

08:32.446 --> 08:34.709
Peggy, you're not supposed to see this!

08:35.029 --> 08:35.970
Listen, honey...

08:35.950 --> 08:36.691
I love you.

08:37.052 --> 08:38.173
Please don't die on me.

08:38.534 --> 08:41.018
I love you too, but oh, jeez.

08:41.098 --> 08:44.663
All right, I'll see a doctor if you just get out and leave me be.

08:44.723 --> 08:46.646
You will?

08:47.568 --> 08:47.968
Oh, Hank.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.052
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

08:50.332 --> 08:51.414
Yeah, well, come on.

08:51.474 --> 08:52.255
Get a move on.

08:52.275 --> 08:54.418
Oh, thank you.

08:54.879 --> 08:55.199
Get!

09:00.267 --> 09:04.033
And what exactly are you seeing Dr. Morley about today?

09:04.216 --> 09:12.208
Uh, uh, well, I've been, uh, or, uh, actually, I haven't been... Sir, you're going to have to speak up.

09:12.228 --> 09:22.744
I-I need to see him about a, uh, problem with, uh... Sir, just fill this out and have a seat.

09:25.449 --> 09:26.630
Oh!

09:26.650 --> 09:28.633
Bobby, put that down, you do not know where it's been, honey.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.017
Come on, I'm trying to fill this thing out.

09:36.599 --> 09:37.220
Hanky.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.961
Mrs. McIntosh?

09:39.502 --> 09:40.543
Hank Hill.

09:41.544 --> 09:42.865
Is this your family?

09:44.006 --> 09:46.588
I was your father's third grade teacher.

09:47.029 --> 09:47.129
Oh?

09:47.589 --> 09:48.870
Why are you here, Hanky?

09:49.491 --> 09:51.553
This is an old person's doctor.

09:51.573 --> 09:53.515
Well, Hank hasn't been able to take a... A walk.

09:54.416 --> 09:56.518
I threw my knee out playing touch football.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.159
Mr. Hill, I'm sorry, sir.

09:58.259 --> 09:59.200
I cannot read this.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.041
What does it say?

10:00.181 --> 10:00.501
Con?

10:01.022 --> 10:01.542
Contact?

10:01.782 --> 10:02.243
Contact?

10:02.263 --> 10:03.064
Con what?

10:03.084 --> 10:03.484
Uh...

10:06.569 --> 10:08.233
So how are we doing today?

10:08.293 --> 10:09.816
I'm Dr. Morley.

10:09.856 --> 10:13.304
Let's see, so you're suffering from consumption?

10:13.565 --> 10:14.427
Constipation.

10:15.229 --> 10:16.371
Oh, constipation.

10:16.411 --> 10:18.476
Well, that's quite a different matter.

10:18.496 --> 10:21.523
How long has it been since your last bowel movement?

10:21.638 --> 10:28.924
Well, uh, I usually don't keep track of that kind of thing, but... Five days, and Hank's usual schedule is ever two days.

10:29.345 --> 10:32.227
Of course, when we were first married, he'd go every day.

10:32.287 --> 10:35.630
But then I spoke to his mother, and she said the most interesting thing.

10:35.910 --> 10:40.334
She said when he was a teenager, he would be in that bathroom three or four times a day... Maggie!

10:40.494 --> 10:42.996
Please, Mr. Hill, this is helpful.

10:43.597 --> 10:48.361
Now, your wife is obviously concerned, and if she's concerned, I'm concerned.

10:49.021 --> 10:50.903
I think we'll do a sigmoidoscopy.

10:53.397 --> 10:55.078
Say, honey, aren't you glad we're here?

10:56.480 --> 10:57.240
Hi, Mr. Hill.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.562
Why don't you go ahead and take off your pants for me, OK?

11:10.092 --> 11:10.812
Why are you stopping?

11:11.073 --> 11:13.295
Well, no sense in doing this now.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.497
I'll just wait until the doctor comes back.

11:16.317 --> 11:19.220
Sir, you're going to need to take your pants off for Dr. Morley.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.763
OK.

11:24.869 --> 11:29.594
Well, look at that, pig.

11:30.916 --> 11:31.797
Cotton balls.

11:33.659 --> 11:34.199
White ones.

11:36.662 --> 11:37.844
Whole jar of them.

11:39.545 --> 11:41.468
How many do you think there are in there?

11:43.810 --> 11:44.791
I'll bet 30.

11:46.633 --> 11:47.194
Yep.

11:49.256 --> 11:49.797
30.

11:54.215 --> 11:59.721
Okay, Mr. Hill, why don't you hop on the table and undo the back of your gown and we'll have a look at you.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.903
You got all these fancy machines.

12:02.023 --> 12:03.945
Can't you take a picture through the gown?

12:04.226 --> 12:06.228
It's normal to be a little frightened, Mr. Hill.

12:07.029 --> 12:08.330
Just turn your face to the wall.

12:09.892 --> 12:10.833
Oh, you want me to get that?

12:11.093 --> 12:11.434
No.

12:12.915 --> 12:13.476
Mr. Hill?

12:13.696 --> 12:14.797
Mr. Hill, this is Tasha.

12:14.957 --> 12:15.818
She's a medical student.

12:16.399 --> 12:18.681
Would it be all right with you if she observes the examination?

12:19.222 --> 12:21.184
Uh, well, I guess.

12:26.935 --> 12:28.678
We made it, honey.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.501
Quick, 6-4, maternity.

12:30.521 --> 12:46.366
Mr. Hill, this is a special camera that we use to get an inside view of your colon.

12:46.386 --> 12:47.708
Just kill me now.

12:48.229 --> 12:50.112
Mr. Hill, do you wish a bite plate?

12:50.953 --> 12:52.015
Mom, I'm hungry.

12:55.522 --> 12:56.825
Bobby, get outta here!

12:56.845 --> 12:57.786
No, Mr. Hill.

12:58.187 --> 13:01.373
When a family faces an illness, all members should be involved.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.758
Remember, they're your get-well team.

13:04.419 --> 13:05.040
Hey there, Ace.

13:05.421 --> 13:06.483
Do you like video games?

13:06.864 --> 13:07.245
Yeah.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.830
Well, this joystick is just like a video game joystick.

13:10.270 --> 13:12.154
Only my red button fires a real laser.

13:12.675 --> 13:14.018
Cool.

13:14.038 --> 13:17.204
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

13:17.224 --> 13:17.344
Bobby.

13:17.729 --> 13:18.711
Say, you're good.

13:19.171 --> 13:21.314
Maybe you could help us out a little later.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.117
Just kidding, Mr. Hill.

13:23.999 --> 13:26.202
Mr. Hill, it doesn't hurt to smile.

13:26.803 --> 13:27.925
It might actually help.

13:29.046 --> 13:30.228
Tasha, you can begin.

13:34.555 --> 13:35.797
So far, this looks normal.

13:36.358 --> 13:36.778
Normal?

13:37.119 --> 13:39.282
Uh, that's good, right?

13:39.380 --> 13:40.602
Now, this is exciting.

13:40.922 --> 13:44.707
There are so many twists and turns, I can't wait to see what's around the next bend.

13:44.927 --> 13:47.870
The colon has to twist and turn because it's surprisingly long.

13:48.311 --> 13:52.556
You know, Bobby, if I were to take your grandfather's intestine... I'm his father.

13:52.616 --> 13:58.303
Your father's intestine and lay it out in a straight line, it would go all the way around the Earth.

13:58.744 --> 13:59.845
Wow.

13:59.865 --> 14:00.266
Really?

14:01.127 --> 14:03.129
Well, that is amazing, Doctor.

14:03.149 --> 14:04.611
You know, I did not know that.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.192
Now, how could that be?

14:06.232 --> 14:09.417
The Earth is 25,000 miles around.

14:09.457 --> 14:14.005
A piece of steak would have to shoot through your system faster than the speed of sound.

14:14.606 --> 14:15.467
That's impossible.

14:15.848 --> 14:19.894
Well, Mr. Hill, there's certainly nothing going through your intestines that fast.

14:21.276 --> 14:22.098
Hey, I like this.

14:22.498 --> 14:24.622
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?

14:26.505 --> 14:30.531
Mr. Hill, I'm going to have to ask you to relax your buttocks for me, please.

14:37.953 --> 14:39.154
How are you holding up, Mrs. Hill?

14:39.655 --> 14:40.335
I'm okay.

14:41.096 --> 14:43.939
I'm just a little uncomfortable from sitting here for so long.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.463
Okay, let's take a five-minute break.

14:54.189 --> 14:57.412
Well, Mr. Hill, we're not exactly sure what's causing your problem.

14:58.113 --> 15:00.895
So at this point, the best option might be to remove something surgically.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.800
I'm sorry, but apparently your low-fat, high-fiber diet is not working.

15:05.813 --> 15:09.900
Well, maybe Hank just needs to give his low-fat, high-fiber diet a little more time.

15:10.461 --> 15:11.522
Isn't that right, Hank?

15:11.863 --> 15:13.305
Yes, yes, all right.

15:14.327 --> 15:17.372
Just to be safe, I'll book an operating room for the end of the week.

15:17.953 --> 15:18.854
Oh, God.

15:18.995 --> 15:19.435
Don't worry.

15:19.956 --> 15:24.063
You know, it's possible to live a long, healthy, slightly less active life without a colon.

15:25.465 --> 15:26.607
You just can't wear shorts.

15:33.438 --> 15:34.419
Not dogs.

15:34.940 --> 15:35.461
Now, what are these?

15:35.541 --> 15:36.141
Hot dogs?

15:36.442 --> 15:38.544
No, they're not dogs.

15:38.965 --> 15:40.006
They're made of tofu.

15:40.286 --> 15:40.927
Tofu?

15:41.027 --> 15:42.129
I can't eat that crap.

15:42.349 --> 15:43.971
Then try this fofu.

15:44.452 --> 15:47.135
It's a tofu substitute for the tofu intolerant.

15:47.776 --> 15:47.916
Mm-hmm.

15:47.936 --> 15:50.059
Now, would that be good for a man who's constipated?

15:50.179 --> 15:50.519
Peggy.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.081
Well, I didn't say it was you.

15:52.582 --> 15:53.743
Is this for your husband?

15:53.823 --> 15:54.544
Yes.

15:54.564 --> 15:56.687
And we will also take a quarter of your brown rice broth.

15:57.187 --> 15:58.930
Do you have anything that tastes good?

15:59.811 --> 16:01.393
Hmm.

16:01.413 --> 16:01.673
Uh...

16:02.935 --> 16:04.116
No.

16:04.136 --> 16:05.418
Ooh, look at this, Uncle Hank.

16:05.958 --> 16:11.605
Experience moxibustion with Mr. Lee, board-certified moxibustionist.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.789
Relieves stress and opens the energy channels.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.631
What the hell is that?

16:17.051 --> 16:19.554
He sticks needles in your skin and sets them on fire.

16:19.734 --> 16:22.257
Anyone ever try that on me, I'll kick his ass.

16:24.059 --> 16:25.521
No, watch out behind you!

16:25.601 --> 16:25.901
No!

16:26.322 --> 16:27.183
Oh, God.

16:27.323 --> 16:29.145
Gatorade all down his back.

16:30.172 --> 16:31.114
Hank, it's two o'clock.

16:31.354 --> 16:31.975
Bathroom time.

16:32.315 --> 16:34.179
Peg, can I just... Bathroom time.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.062
All right.

16:38.966 --> 16:39.768
Hi there, Peggy.

16:40.068 --> 16:43.934
We were wondering if Hank could come out and help us with my fence.

16:43.954 --> 16:45.257
Oh, I'm sorry, Dale.

16:45.277 --> 16:46.799
Hank is having his bathroom time.

16:47.260 --> 16:51.066
Maybe later.

17:14.688 --> 17:30.046
Well, thank you all for coming.

17:30.707 --> 17:33.690
I thought it would help cheer Hank up to have all of his friends here.

17:34.371 --> 17:36.053
I think he's making a lot of progress.

17:36.493 --> 17:37.775
Well, where are you going, Hank?

17:38.075 --> 17:38.556
To the bathroom.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.719
Now just try to relax, Hank, and concentrate.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.041
This could be it.

17:47.408 --> 17:48.430
Peggy, please!

17:50.594 --> 18:04.000
Come on, Hank.

18:17.547 --> 18:22.173
No, no, see what I'm saying is salad don't always have to have salad in it.

18:22.193 --> 18:24.136
See, there's potato salad in it.

18:25.117 --> 18:25.397
Ooh.

18:27.099 --> 18:28.922
I'm sorry, Peg, I let you down.

18:29.523 --> 18:30.364
Let y'all down.

18:30.684 --> 18:31.625
Don't you worry, Hank.

18:32.186 --> 18:39.015
We still have 24 hours before your appointment, and we're gonna make the most of it.

19:06.417 --> 19:09.141
You know, Hank seems a little down.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.944
Well, he's a shell of a man.

19:11.404 --> 19:14.749
I never thought Hank would have the willpower to give up everything he enjoyed in life.

19:15.070 --> 19:15.991
Well, that's not Hank.

19:16.311 --> 19:16.812
That's me.

19:17.213 --> 19:22.000
I mean, if it was up to him, he'd still be eating burgers in the backyard with Dale, Bill, and BoomHour.

19:22.360 --> 19:29.691
He'd still be drinking beer and shouting at the TV set and having a lot of fun.

19:36.218 --> 19:36.720
Wait here.

19:39.250 --> 19:39.491
So?

19:40.214 --> 19:41.018
So what?

19:41.198 --> 19:47.022
Well, I heard a... I mean, I wasn't listening, but I did hear a... Oh, that was my glasses.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.601
Look, honey, we gotta talk.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.407
I know you want to help, but this is getting out of control.

19:55.007 --> 19:57.551
You can't treat a grown man like a baby.

19:58.012 --> 19:58.693
It ain't right.

19:59.233 --> 20:06.844
I feel like I've been trying to be someone else lately, eating food I don't eat, and I'm just not gonna do it anymore.

20:07.305 --> 20:10.649
And if I don't ever poop again, well, that's just gonna be who I am.

20:11.390 --> 20:15.816
I'd rather die with a burger in my colon than live and eat foe-foo.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.460
Hank, I know and.

20:18.997 --> 20:19.919
It's okay, you're right.

20:20.500 --> 20:20.721
What?

20:21.302 --> 20:26.272
Well, I'm only doing this because I want you to be around as long as possible because I love you.

20:27.194 --> 20:29.378
But I have to let you be you.

20:29.418 --> 20:31.943
Oh, thank you.

20:32.685 --> 20:34.990
I'll still be here for a good long while.

20:35.150 --> 20:35.671
I worry.

20:36.272 --> 20:36.994
I know you do.

20:37.134 --> 20:38.136
That you could.

20:38.740 --> 20:39.741
I know, honey.

20:40.342 --> 20:42.565
And I'm a lucky son of a gun, I tell you what.

20:43.126 --> 20:48.032
To have a woman like you care so much about me, I'm gonna be more open.

20:48.552 --> 20:50.034
Tell you how I'm doing more.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.676
And let you in.

20:53.058 --> 20:55.822
I just want this moment to last forever, Hank.

20:56.062 --> 20:56.623
Me too.

20:58.966 --> 20:59.706
But it can't.

21:00.047 --> 21:01.969
Oh, hold me, Hank.

21:01.989 --> 21:02.210
No.

21:02.730 --> 21:02.971
No.

21:03.531 --> 21:03.972
Let go.

21:04.112 --> 21:04.933
Let go.

21:11.933 --> 21:16.813
Hmm.

21:40.402 --> 22:07.270
you might have noticed in tonight's episode there was some brief nudity now as an actor I only do nudity when I feel the script warrants it and I thought tonight's episode only warranted seeing the side of my rump you can believe me when I tell you the Fox executives were pushing for a whole lot more if any of you were offended by my body I'm truly sorry good night
