Bobby ought to leave a burger for your mother.
She'll be hungry after her big meeting.
She knows what time dinner is.
Boy, select me five.
The school picked my float design for the Veterans Day Parade.
We are recreating the famous flag-raising scene at Iwo Hima.
Oh, like last year's school float.
Yes, but what Principal Moss loved most about my idea was how authentic it will be.
Each mannequin will be wearing authentic medals awarded for bravery at Iwo Hima.
Hey, you know who might have some of those?
That oddball who runs that brick-a-brack store.
Mm-mm, move to Provincetown.
No, in my capacity as float committee chairman, I will place a toll call to your father in Houston and ask him for his purple heart, silver star, and whatever else they gave him for killing all those Japanese.
Boy, this is a choice cut of North Carolina pine.
The perfect wood to honor our veterans.
It will be under 600 pounds of sand.
Don't blow our budget, Hank.
Use that.
Particle board?
Yeah, if you want to throw out your float in five or ten years.
Ten on your tiptoes, DD woman.
Dad?
Well, what are you doing in Arlen?
Buying 192 diapers.
Thanks, wife.
Cotton, I have been calling you.
How long have you been in town?
A week.
We're staying over to the VFW.
We love it there.
Diddy and the baby love it there, too.
Ain't that right, wife?
It's just like a second honeymoon.
Only it's not El Paso.
A week?
Why didn't you call?
I only call the people I want to see.
They're taking out that yield sign by the Ethan Allen.
Lives will be lost.
Smells like pancakes.
I'll have waffles.
Grandpa, I was wondering when I'd get to see you.
And how's my Uncle G.H.?
Waffles?
Where's my waffles?
They're coming right up.
Oh, and Cotton, can I borrow your war medals for my float, please?
What?
I need them medals.
They'll be wearing them in the Veterans Parade.
That's right, Bobby.
Your granddad carries the flag every year down in Houston.
Not this year, Bobby.
I'll be marching here in Ireland.
With my ward buddies, Topsy, Brooklyn, Fat Brooklyn, and of course, Irwin Linker.
What happened to Lucky?
Dead!
Good going, Dale.
That looks like some top quality sand you got there.
Yeah, they won't be building any sand castles over at Stalbach Elementary this week.
Look what I signed out for the weekend.
It might not shift out a second, but it'll tow a float eight city blocks Or if we attach a steel extrusion to the front we could push the float Am I the only one who allows his mind to prance outside the box?
Hello?
Cotton?
Peggy, my stepdaughter-in-law.
Why are you here?
Oh, well.
I came across this box of brand new cigars, and I know how much Cotton enjoys cigars, so... Oh, these are not Cotton's brand.
He won't like them.
But I do.
I'll smoke them.
Oh my, you certainly have brought a lot for your vacation.
And in which box would I find Cotton's war medals, please?
The medals are in a locked display case in the lobby next to the vending machine where we get dinner.
Come on, Topsy, is it you, or is it you?
Dimzy's rich pot dimzy's.
Nice word.
Yoo-hoo, Dad!
Entertainment's here!
Take off your top!
Ah, it takes life!
What do you want?
I'm up eight cents!
Well, I noticed your authentic war medals in the lobby display.
All right, you want my medals.
Okay, I'll give them to you.
Cost you $200 a day.
There's only one way you could make that, except you're 20 years too old and 20 pounds too skinny.
Carl Neal, I do not know what I hate more about you.
The way you talk to me, or the way you treat your wife and your little child.
Well, think about it.
Oh.
Selfish, selfish, selfish.
He is making his wife and your little brother stay in that tiny room just so he can play cards all day with that foul mouth Irwin Linker.
Well, it's not all bad.
GH is too young to understand cuss words and the Brooklands are very good with him.
I've seen it.
Rob Reiner says that the first year of life is the most important to a child's development.
Your baby brother should be listening to lullabies, not to old men hacking up phlegm.
All right, all right.
I'll go down there tomorrow and talk to my dad.
Do you think the nail on my pinky toe will ever grow back?
You're supposed to yield, you... Oh, not anymore.
Thanks a lot, Councilman Fred Ebert.
Jerk.
What in the...
Sir, there are only 50 cans here.
53!
This hobo took three cans from my pile.
I got those cans from a sewer outside the bus station.
Them three cans was my cans.
I smashed them myself.
I smashed them good.
You're lying!
This dumpster monkey is lying!
Whoever hands me the cans gets the money.
Here.
What the cuss perk?
I need that money.
Give me that!
This is just my house.
I gots to live in the F.S.M.Y.
I'm broke!
Broke?
You have no money and you lost the house in Houston.
How could this happen?
Did you blow it all on exotic dancers?
Don't you judge me.
My pension barely covered me and the woman.
I didn't plan on busting through my weenie shield and having this little fella.
And I can't deny him anything in the world though I can.
Cotton tried to find a job in Houston, but nobody wanted him.
Well, DeeDee, you're a certified optometrical assistant.
There's lens crafters down at the... Now, why the mind is gonna work?
Look, Dad, I've got a few extra dollars in my past book account.
I could help you out.
You ain't my daddy.
I'm your... daddy.
Topsy.
No, no, no, no, no.
Show Hank... the door.
All right, back off.
God.
Dad, I could talk to Buck Strickland about getting you a job at Strickland Propane.
I don't need your charity job.
I got me an interview tomorrow.
Getting back into the insulation business.
Same work that kept your mother and JC penny skirts and paid for your glasses all them years.
For eyes.
I'm your man, Mr. Lewis.
I supervise the installation of asbestos in every public school in Hamlet County and 11 bowling alleys.
Yeah, our company is paid to remove asbestos.
What?
What?
What?
Remove asbestos?
What the hell for?
You wrote on your application that you're 38 years old.
Is that right?
Indeed!
I tend to look older because the Japanese shot my shins off in the war.
Which war?
Gulf War!
Now hold on there, you can't ask an applicant his age.
I'm sorry, who is this?
I'm his son.
Gulf War baby!
Saddam's chemicals made him freakishly large!
Yeah, we'll be sure to give you a call.
I tell you Hank, ever since you sold me those propane patio heaters, people have been eating outside, even when it's cold.
Well, clean even heating is just one of the 14 reasons.
Yeah, yeah, I remember your toast at my daughter's wedding.
Now listen, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just give me a holler.
Mr. Burton, are you a fan of World War II heroes?
So you're my Uncle Bert's new hire.
Now this is your stool.
When people come in, you give them the special greeting.
Did you learn the special greeting?
I said it on it!
Good for you.
Break times in an hour.
You get three ounces of beef or five ounces of chicken and one starch.
Mm-hmm.
Welcome to Burton's.
The hostess will seat you.
Welcome to Burton's.
The hostess will seat you.
Oh, alright.
She's tied up.
Momentarily, right this way.
W-w-w-w-w-w-what are you doing?
He was waiting, I'm showing him to a table.
That's the hostess's job.
You're a greeter.
Now please return to your stool.
Now you listen to me, junior.
I let a platoon of men through the jungle's aside pan.
I think I can lead a party of four to table six.
I'm sure you can.
But right now, what I need you to do is go back to your stool.
You think I can't do it?
I've done everything for this country.
I gave my shins to beat the Tojos.
I've been a nazi's windpipe in higher!
My stew-o, where's the greeter stew-o?
Congratulations, you've been promoted to men's room attendant.
What?
Ah.
Sorry about that.
Good afternoon, King Folk.
Who knew there was so much money and greeting?
Hop in.
I'm gonna treat all the hillboys to some ice cream.
My work here is done.
Cotton, look at the detail on this float.
Now, I'd say it's a second place float right now.
All it needs to move up to first are authentic war medals.
You're such a nag.
Now I know why I hate close to divorce you.
Dad, there's not a shred of truth.
Mull it over.
That's the one.
Get out of my Cadillac car!
It's my car now.
You're five months behind on your payments.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Lane Prattley.
Prattley, Cadillac and Hyundai.
Well, hold on a minute now.
There's got to be something that we can work out here.
It's too late for that, Hank.
But it's not too late to put you into a brand-new Sonata.
Only 52,000 miles on her.
She's practically a dealer car.
And cut your dick out!
Dad, no!
Get off my block!
Well, thank you very much, Hank, for helping me chop him up.
You a re-a-cat like Gar?
Mr. Hill, you're late.
Couldn't reach the ding chord on the bus.
Now listen up, Junior.
I ain't gonna be here tomorrow.
I'm marching in the Veterans Parade, and I still get my full pay.
And not on my watch.
Veterans Day is one of our busiest days.
We're right on the parade route.
I need you in the men's room on your stool.
You can't do that.
I killed Fitty Man.
That parade is for me.
Mr. Hill, maybe you have to re-evaluate whether you really want to clean up after my customers use the bathroom.
Your mother stayed up all night putting the finishing touches on that float.
Never came to bed.
You put skeletons on Iwo Jima?
Without your father's medals, the whole authentic concept didn't work.
I had to go in a different direction.
The futility of war.
Peggy, you can't make fun of war heroes in a veteran's parade.
It is a tribute.
Those are skeletons, Peggy.
Well, old Halloween decorations were the best I could do at 4 AM, Hank.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to take three buses.
One to get here, one to go back and get GH, and then one to get here.
Where's my dad?
He had to work.
A veteran working on Veterans Day?
That ain't right.
Dad?
You in here?
They said you were back here.
I'm on my break from my greeter's job.
What do you want?
I'm busy!
Well, I stopped by the VFW and picked up your dress uniform, your marching shoes.
I can't march today.
I'm too big of a man here.
That's too much responsibility.
Dad, you're the greatest war hero Ireland's ever seen.
You should be marching in that parade.
Can't.
Well, I'm just gonna leave your uniform on this bar stool.
If you change your mind.
I beg your pardon.
Oh, sorry.
Would you believe this isn't the first time that's happened to me?
Ass.
Happy Veterans Day!
Happy Veterans Day!
I told you, we'll bring your meal into you.
Ah, here.
Do it it for the baby.
Do it it for the baby.
My kettle, that cup.
He climbed up there!
I'll get that zombie!
Oh good, my dad decided to join the parade after all.
Good lord!
I love a parade.
Scoot over, my dad stole his car back.
We can't agree on it, then Bob and I will go to Del Taco and you two go to Taco Bell, okay?
I ain't no stinkhouse porter.
You think a shindless man can't remove asbestos?
I'll show you what a 75-year-old shindless man can remove.
Told you it was a rug.
Sixty and one smash.
Sixty and two smash.
Sixty and three.
Go, you.
These are my kids.
Hey, fingers, you ain't counting fast enough.
Sixty and four.
Sixty and five.
Sixty and six.
Sixty and seven.
Sixty and eight, nine.
Sixty and ten.
Sixty and eleven.
That's it.
You shouldn't be waiting for a plus.
You strangled Herman Garyford, God's sake.
Please don't kill me.
Oh, I won't.
But in a few minutes, you was gonna wish you was dead.
That's your time, sir.
Yeah, thanks.
That's standing work, Sergeant.
Reminds me of the old days.
All right, who's next?
Who's next?
There's nobody left.
And I still ain't done nothing to help my family.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on.
This is where you think.
Come see, let's roll, and you think.
Sorry, Tappington.
Some things a man has to do on his own.
I'm sorry we never got to go for that ice cream cone, Bobby.
Looks like we're not going to get the chance.
Just as well.
I don't have any money.
I've got that share of US Steel you bought me when I was born.
We could cash that in.
Uh-uh.
You should put that money into life insurance.
Best thing I ever did.
I'm worth more dead than alive.
What do you mean, Grandpa?
Is there a price on your head?
Probably.
Here you go.
I've written you a letter of recommendation for the Army.
Give this to the general when you turn 15.
Grandpa was just here.
He was acting all weird.
He kept talking about how important it is to have life insurance.
The colonel asked me for some ammunition.
Which, due to the spectacular failure of Y2K, I had plenty of.
Knowing you, you gave it all to him.
No.
I tried to, but he said he only needed one bullet.
One bullet?
Damn it, Dale.
Cotton, I have been watching GH all day.
It is your turn.
Not now, woman.
Yes, now.
I need some me time to do the laundry.
Dad, Dad, open up.
Come on, let me in.
Go away.
This doesn't involve you.
Dad!
He just thought the boy had a favorite gun!
Look at him!
He loves to shoot!
You cried your first time, and you was three!
Oh, you were just... Well, I thought you were... What?
I was spending time with my favorite son.
You got a problem with that?
No.
No, I don't.
Hank, I thought it over.
I've decided to let you give me some money.
You know, for GH.
Well, I'm glad you've come around, and I'm happy to help you out.
It ain't a help.
You're paying me back for all the money I spent raising you.
Food, clothes, sissy lenses for your eyes.
Okay, Dad.
Uh, that seems fair.
It's more than fair.
I'm even charging you interest, because you're my son and all.
Now, give me three hundred dollars.
I wanna buy G.H.
and me a set of walkie-talkies.
You know, hope it when he learns to walk and talk.
Well, I've got a twenty on me.
Twenty bucks?
I got poop tips bigger than that.
Ah!
Waffles!
Where's my waffles?
