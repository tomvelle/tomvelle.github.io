Come on, lady bird, fetch!
That's right, you can get it.
Come on, girl.
Fine, it can stay there for all I care.
Get it, come on.
Get him the ball already.
Here you go, boy.
Take it easy on Lady Bird, Bobby.
She's 91 years old and dog years.
Each time she fetches, it's like seven fetches for you or me.
Well, tell Lady Bird I'm done playing, because she only listens to you.
That a girl.
Hold on, little fella.
This happened to me once.
You hungry?
Well, let's see what Santa's got in his goodie bag.
What a crime.
If you are not a hungry man, Luanne, you shouldn't be taking on the hungry man dinner.
Uh-uh, Bobby, at the table.
I am tired of finding crumbs in the bath tub.
Is it me or are they making these things bigger?
You don't want that.
Tonight's garbage is... I brought you something special.
You know, the black around your eyes looks just like a mask.
I'm gonna call you... Maskey.
No, wait, wait, wait.
I can beat that.
Bandit.
Mind if I join you?
And how about a marshmallow chaser?
Fish.
Snakes.
Yep, a dog's the only animal that makes sense.
And I suppose a cat might work if you're a little girl or an old lady, you know, who's sick.
Can I buy this, Dad?
Bobby, this is a pet store, not a toy store.
You know how much they mark that junk up.
Excuse me, how much is it to get your dog's picture put on this mug?
So we're eating dinner and Lady Bird starts to beg.
That says it all right there.
Mrs. Gribble said it wasn't going to rain.
Accurate weather, my foot.
Here, I'm going to leave this open and you can use the street light as a night light.
You're going to wish you messed up somebody else's garage, you furry bastard.
I'm gonna take out the garbage now Bobby there is a raccoon out there and it almost Literally attacked your father raccoon.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get rid of it and it was just hungry dad Bandit Bobby you name a pet you name a guitar You do not name a filthy animal and you do not feed it our garbage No wonder it was rooting around in the garage.
It was looking for more of your handouts and
It's not a handout when you feed Lady Bird, is it?
Lady Bird is a member of this family.
You've seen our Christmas cards?
Yeah, I've also seen her drink out of the toilet, wipe herself on the carpet, sniff another dog.
Enough.
Bandit is a wild, disease-ridden animal that will bite your face.
Now, does that sound like something Lady Bird would do?
Lady Bird doesn't do anything anymore.
She's too old.
Bobby.
Lady Bird is in the room.
The whole garage looked like one of those horror movies.
You know, tools all over the place?
Yep.
Sounds like a raccoon.
Or a possum imitating the behavior of a raccoon.
Or a squirrel.
What I'm getting at is, I'll handle it.
No thanks, Dale.
I've already taken care of it.
I put out a spring-loaded live trap this morning.
Ha!
A trap!
The only one that's going to get trapped is you, Hank.
Trapped into thinking a trap actually works.
Who wants to... Get out of here, you furry bastard.
My card.
No worries, Hank.
I have played out this scenario a thousand times in my mind.
Most of them I have won.
Now, are you gonna need the raccoon's pelt intact for a hat?
I thought you were gonna trap Bandit and free him in the woods.
Why is everything you're wearing so sharp?
You're not gonna hurt my raccoon, are you?
That's entirely up to him, Bobby.
Hank, once I crawl in there, I want you to quickly cover the hole with the screen.
That's the only way in and the only way out for the raccoon.
Do not remove the screen.
No matter how much I plead or beg you, do not remove the screen.
Hank!
Open the screen!
My God, thanks, Hank!
I'm begging you!
Open the screen!
That's it.
I'm taking off the screen.
You promised there you wouldn't.
That's enough.
Get off her!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Lady Bird!
Andy!
Come back!
Oh my god!
Lady Bird's hurt!
Someone call 911!
I give you one little thing to do, and you screw it up.
I can't find Lady Bird anywhere.
Ted!
Any luck, son?
I looked all over the neighborhood.
No sign of Bandit.
Not even a dropping.
What?
You've been looking for that dang raccoon?
It would've attacked me if it weren't for Lady Bird.
And now my dog's out there possibly hurt, exposed to the elements.
And even if she does find something to eat, who's gonna mix in an egg?
I'll find Lady Bird.
Lucky for you, I'm not only an exterminator, I'm also a bounty hunter.
My other card.
Tell me I sent ya, you'll get 10% off.
That picture was taken at her birthday party last month.
Sorry, I don't have a more recent photo.
Mr. Hill, I don't want to get your hopes up.
The odds of finding a dog that has run away are not- Lady Bird did not run away.
She got in a fight with the raccoon and took off after it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Raccoon.
Hank, let me take over.
As one animal controlled professional to another, it was what appeared to be a raccoon.
But I only saw it briefly and it was dark, so I don't know.
Well, it's too bad you didn't catch it.
Because without being able to autopsy the raccoon, we have no way of knowing if it gave your dog rabies.
Rabies?
Now, as I said, I am an animal control professional.
Explain to Hank how you get rabies.
Raccoon bites the most common way, followed by rat bites, and then raccoon scratches.
What?
Oh, raccoon scratches moved up to third.
Good for them.
What does it say?
Well, the earliest symptoms of clinical rabies in humans are chills.
I'm cold, Nancy.
So cold.
You're in your underwear, Shug.
Read on.
Some sufferers may have a sore throat.
My throat's on fire.
Diarrhea.
Go on.
They may also feel anxious or fearful of things with no clear reason.
Nancy, I think I have rabies.
Dale, you're gonna be fine.
All we have to do is get you to a doctor so they can give you a shot.
Sorry, seven shots.
Let's say I don't get the shots.
Is it possible to live a normal life infected with rabies?
No.
And please make sure Lady Bird is safe and without rabies.
And if rabies is part of your divine plan, then please change your plan and send us back Lady Bird rabies free.
And Bandit too, amen.
No, sir.
Bandit is not in this prayer.
It's Bandit's fault we're in this mess, or your fault for feeding him.
I'll let you decide, Lord.
Now, Hank, I know Lady Bird is just fine.
She saved your life.
I'm sure she can save her own.
Well, I hope you're right.
But if she's out there suffering with rabies, I'll have to shoot her.
And with my aim, I'll probably have to shoot her twice.
Oh, God.
Okay, Lady Bird, good.
Rabies bad.
I just want to find Bandit.
We all want to find Bandit, Bobby.
It's the only way they can figure out if Lady Bird's got rabies.
How do they do that?
Well, they, uh, take off its head.
I don't want to abuse the privilege, but I need you to get Dale out of the basement again.
All right, everybody ready?
And go.
Dale, honey!
Pizza's here!
Mmm, pizza!
No!
Nancy!
Look, Nancy!
They're taking... No!
All right, Dale.
We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way.
Do it the hard way.
I'm worried about Bandit.
I'm worried about my dad.
And Bandit.
See, I settled down.
Now give me back my hat.
Oh yeah, it's easy for you to sit there with a head full of thick, gorgeous hair, laughing at me.
Please.
I told you, Dale, I'll give you the hat back after you get the shots.
Dale, where are you?
Hey!
Dale, get back here!
Dale!
Okay, a raccoon, ladybird, and Dale are on the loose and they all might be rabid.
Peggy, you should stay here in case Ladybird comes home.
Not if Hank, whether or not.
The rest of us are going to cover every inch of Ireland.
And I'm going to need somebody to help Nancy in case Dale comes home.
Okay, any volunteers?
I had my hand up first.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Survival Diary Update I have been drinking dew drops found on the forest leaves and I have been eating mushrooms and moss.
Mostly, mushrooms.
My rabies has taken a turn for the worse.
I am starting to hallucinate.
When I close my eyes, I can see strange characters running around chasing colorful geometric shapes in a dark and infinite limbo.
I have stopped closing my eyes.
I fear I am going mad.
Survival reminder, need hammer and nails.
And batteries for tape recorder.
Also need new tape recorder.
Dale?
Yeehaw!
You need a shot, Shug!
Hello?
Mr. Hill, this is Big Terry from Animal Control.
We've had reports of a bloodhound walking kinda funny out by the campgrounds at the Mariella Sherry Shiver State Park.
We're in there now.
Okay, I'm on my way.
Just in case you find her first, when you call her name, say the first half longer than the second.
Lady Bird, you got that?
Uh, Mr. Hill, if we get there and the dog is acting strange, we'll have to put Lady Bird down.
Oh, no.
Mr. Hill, are you there?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant, we'll have to put Lady Bird down.
Mr. Hill?
Now Bill, if you see Lady Bird first, fire this flare straight up in the air, not at her.
All right, Bobby, look out!
Ah!
False alarm!
What are you doing, Bobby?
If you're looking for that raccoon, you're wasting your time.
It's probably two towns over by now eating some other kid's garbage.
At least Bandit never ate my lunch until after I'd thrown it out.
That's what I'd call common courtesy.
Yeah.
I remember the time Lady Bird jumped up and ate your peanut butter sandwich right off your plate.
I thought she'd never stop licking the roof of her mouth.
I'll tell you what.
I never laughed that hard ever again.
Lady Bird, come here girl.
Come to daddy so he can send you to doggy heaven.
Ow!
What the heck?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Dad, you're okay.
Don't look him in the eye, it makes him start howling.
Thought you could just waltz in here and kill me, did ya?
Well, so did he.
Damn it, Dale.
You stupid- You will speak only when I say you can speak.
Remove the tape, Dale.
Okay.
You can speak.
Let us go now, and I promise I won't kick your ass later.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that, Hank.
I've got plans for you.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to drain all the blood out of your body.
Then I'm going to replace my blood with your non-rabid blood, which will both cure me and give me all your knowledge of propane and propane accessories.
I think you might be eating the wrong kind of mushrooms, Dale.
I know what I'm doing.
These mushrooms have been keeping me alive.
But what I don't know, Hank, is how you can still talk when there's a million bugs squiggling in and out of your mouth.
Oh, yeah, I can talk.
And you just wait until Bill and Boomhauer find us.
Wee!
Run and move!
Water's dirty!
No, they don't run and move.
Let's see you try and sell your way out of this one, propane salesman.
Where's your precious propane now?
Yeah, you got me, Dale.
There is no way out of this.
So, if I understand your plan, it is to replace your rabies blood with my clean blood, is that right?
Who gave you a copy of my plan?
You told me.
So, uh, step one, drain my blood.
And, uh, since you can't stand the sight of blood, I guess you'll have to hand me my pocket knife.
Oh, I'll do more than hand it to ya.
I'll open it for ya.
Uh, you might want to step back, Dale.
There is going to be a lot of blood.
A lot.
Okay, there.
That's the vein.
Ow.
Boy, that smarts.
Wait a minute.
You've never cried out in pain in your life.
That's what I get for trusting you to drain your own blood.
Yeah!
Okay, Dale.
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have done that.
I should have cut my veins.
Shut up!
I'm tired of your face.
Ladybird!
All right, dog.
You want a tango?
Bobby, the knife!
Get your dog away from me!
He's got the rabies!
Lady Bird, down girl!
Dad, watch out!
That's it.
That's it.
Come here.
She's got rabies.
She'll bite you.
No, she's just wounded and scared.
I'm her master.
She'd never bite me.
Dad, look out!
Bobby, don't!
Shooter!
Shooter with the gun!
Bobby, no!
Yes, Bobby!
You missed her!
Oh, ladybird.
You see, I was right.
It's a good thing you missed, Bobby.
I didn't miss that.
Bandit?
I saw him coming.
I think he was gonna bite you.
This...
isn't over.
So long, suckers.
I can see your house from up here.
I guess I'm glad Bandit didn't have rabies.
So at least we know Lady Bird and Mr. Gribble will be okay.
That's right, son.
Thanks for building the cross.
No problem, Bobby.
I'm gonna say a few words now, Dad.
I understand.
Ah, amen.
Say, Bobby, I know this won't be for a while, but when Lady Bird dies, how about if I let you pick our next pet?
Really?
Okay.
I'm gonna get a possum.
No.
No possums.
And I'll stretch then.
Well, I was thinking more of a traditional pet, Bobby.
Like another dog.
Okay.
Can I get a poodle?
No.
So long, suckers!
