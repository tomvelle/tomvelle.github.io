He approaches the green he thinks better of it and packs away two steps and Three steps wake up girl.
You don't want to miss all the excitement Wesley tongue is now three inches from the putting surface Electrify heart pounding that grass was topped a few days ago, but it's still a bit thick a terrible challenge Help
I'm just hearing things, right, girl?
This is an absolutely crucial chip.
Please, Hank!
Help, Bill!
Help!
Help!
Not again.
Help me, Hank!
I'm trapped!
Thanks, buddy!
I was looking for change under there and I got stuck.
I'm ordering the pizza.
Hungry?
No, and don't bring it to my house.
A gushing geyser of golf greatness.
Wouldn't you agree, Hank?
I forgot you missed it.
All told a treasury of golden golf memories, but only for those who actually saw this storied golf.
You officially owe me one memorable sports moment.
Dang it.
Lately my scalp's been itching like crazy.
You too?
I thought my spider sense was tingling to warn me of danger.
Unless we both have spider sense.
Finally, we can talk about something besides who ruined who's golf watching day.
My scalp is itchy, too.
It's lice, you know.
What?
No, man.
There's a lady in town who does lice treatment for school kids.
She's so pretty.
So I stuck my arms into a big pile of hair.
We cut off some new recruits.
And those little critties, they just hopped right aboard me.
If any of you guys know better, way to meet the Lies Lady, I'd like to hear it.
You gave us all lies, you disgusting heat freak!
Uh, hi, Hank.
Boom-Hour, your bathroom is gorgeous.
Can I bring Nancy by tonight after dinner?
Okay, everybody, heads in the tub.
Now, according to the label, all the lice should be dead, and our hair should be bouncy and manageable.
So, how's everybody feel?
Ah, man, a dang old bunker in, man.
It took me a long time to clean out now, man.
I don't, ah, got a dang old way into this stuff, man.
Ah!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
together, Dale.
I don't want to have to put the plastic cone around your neck.
Lies are nothing to be ashamed of.
If it's nothing, why are you still wearing your shower cap?
Am I?
No.
Why so I am?
That is so funny.
I'll just take it off when I go outside where it'll be easier to take off.
God dang, Bill.
Ever since Lenore left him, I've done nothing but cut him slack.
He sleeps on my car.
He's always stealing ladybird squeaky toys.
Remember when he kept a chamber pot by his bed?
He keeps burying his porno in our backyard and he... Well, I can't put up with it forever.
It ends today.
Yep.
Yep.
Well, the lice lady's booked up for weeks.
Big epidemic at the Cub Scout Jamboree.
She says the only thing we can do is shave our heads.
Ding!
Better idea!
As an exterminator, I will take steps to spare us the shame of hairlessness.
A mixture of malathion and lindane.
Fairly harmless, according to the government, which has been squirting it at you for most of your life.
Dang it, Dale.
I don't like the whole head-shaving thing either, but... YEP!
Get lost, Bill!
Observe.
Simple enough.
And tingling.
And burning.
Itching, itching, burning.
And blindness.
Intense burning.
Can't get your hose.
No!
Cack!
I don't want to play lawn games, too.
But nobody wants Bill's head on their lawn.
Oh, no.
Bill has lice.
He's no good.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Nice sock.
Oh, you usually get a case.
No, that's back when I had friends to share a beer with.
Can I drink here?
No.
Just you and me, mailbox.
There you go, buddy.
Uh, sir?
You can't do that.
Oops.
I'm sorry, Buzz.
Butty.
All right, sir.
Time to come downtown.
I got a 149 on a 344.
Oh, did I?
Sorry.
No, no, no, no.
Woo!
You catching Northside Burger?
No, he's a drunk.
Is a 149 a burglary, Doug?
You said 149?
I thought you said I got the burglar.
No!
He said 149!
Sorry, I'm a little drunk.
I have always wanted to use one of these.
Bobby, don't you have something better to do than watch this?
Oh, right.
Like I'm supposed to go do my homework when my dad is getting his head shaved.
Let's get this done with.
It'll be one less thing to remind me of Bill.
Hank, thank God you're home.
Or the hell else would I be?
I'm sitting here getting my head shaved, thanks to you.
I'm in jail.
I fed a mailbox.
I only get one phone call and I called you.
My pastest, oldest friend in the world.
You have to come down here.
No.
Nancy shaved me.
She did my armpits, too.
I feel so clean.
Hank, boom, how are me or shaved?
Are you shaved yet, Hank?
Oh, Hank, you are going to look awfully steadily when I'm through.
What?
Hank, why have you never told me you have a tattoo?
What?
That's impossible.
I don't have a... I am looking right at it.
Who is she, huh?
Your first love?
Some roadhouse tramp?
Bill?
Dang it!
How could this be here?
Get off me!
Hank, it's a tattoo!
You cannot rub it off with a washcloth!
God dang it!
How does a man lose track of the back of his own head?
A tattoo?
I've been lying every time I donated blood.
That's a matter, buddy.
I'm the matter.
I screw everything up.
All my friends are mad at me because I gave them lies.
You got lies?
No, so spit when I talk, and I fart when I spit.
That's what makes the world interesting.
Hank, so you're the Northside burglar.
Wait here a minute.
Nancy, will you bring me a gun, please?
Knock it off, Dale.
I need to ask you something serious.
Now, can you remember any reason why any of us might have ever gotten a tattoo?
What kind of tattoo?
Like a barcode?
Because that would point to the Rand Corporation.
Good night, Dale.
Mr. Hill, I have to tell you, tattoo removal is very painful and time-consuming.
Are you sure you can't work things out with this bill?
I'm sure.
Oh, come on.
What did he do?
Forget your anniversary.
Look at another guy with a little more hair.
Bill is not my... anything.
I don't even know how it got there.
I just want it off my head now.
Sure, your fingers turned blue from the barber's side, but that's just part of the job.
You have a job?
Sure.
Gotta pay the mortgage somehow.
You got a house!
Well, yeah.
I got it in a divorce.
You were married?
I guess we got a nickname for you.
Well, if anyone can explain your tattoo, it'll be Boomhauer.
He figured out it was Dale who was stealing your paper, remember?
Hey, man, low-hank, Peggy.
Oh, man, you didn't... My little old little skinner, did you?
I don't know, man, low-hank.
I don't think I'm wild, man, man.
All right, Boomhauer, spill it.
I'll tell you what, why don't you go in there and relax and then sit back down and I'm gonna tell you a little story, man.
About a long time ago in a downhill Ireland, far, far away, man.
You know, talk about it at a simpler time, you know, about that old crazy kid, you know, bell bottoms, you know, that disco sucks, you know, like a downhill back in the day, man.
I can't believe Bill joined up.
Every time I exercise my freedoms, I'll think of him protecting them.
I'll wait for you.
Boy, that's the third one today.
And none of them is going to miss him more than me.
Or me.
Or down.
Look at us all mopey.
This isn't any kind of send-off for a soon-to-be-war hero.
Can we see where Lee Harvey Oswald was framed?
Well, I just hope you fellas don't go and have too much fun while I'm gone.
We won't.
This is the last night of fun we'll have till you get back.
Now I want to be the first one to buy the Army man a drink.
The chainsaw.
Probably a hangout for the lumber industry.
Look out, enemies of America!
Here comes our friend Private First Class Bill Dothrieb!
Yeah, man, now it's Bill!
Now, man... Play the gambler!
Come on, play the gambler!
You've got to know when to hold him!
No in the fold, um, bill, bill, bill, bill.
Every time I go to the hardware store and the guy says, okay, here's your bill, I'm gonna say, no it's not.
This is my bill.
Hey Jackass, how'd you like to lose that finger?
Whoa, whoa, there, you watch your language around G.I.
Bill.
Take it easy, friend.
Aren't we all just here to rock?
Boom-ho!
Get Hank out of here!
So Bill saved my butt, and I never even thanked him.
Oh, yes, he did, man.
And I go... Bill knows when to fold him.
He knows when to hold him.
Buh-power, stick with Hank.
It's gonna be a while with Dale.
I had a big dinner.
I tried to join up, too, but they didn't take me.
And they're a-re-thra.
Bill, huh?
That's who.
Hey, man, thank you.
No, man.
Big, big letters here to here.
B-I-L-L, Bill.
OK.
Hey, man, don't eat them.
They're gonna pass out cold, man.
Let's just do it.
We're gonna let it go, man.
I accepted his money.
He's getting his ink.
Oh, okay, man, but let's not cross the dang old chest, man.
Find a place where the dang old sun don't shine, man.
You know, I've been talking about it like I thought you'd never know, man.
The dang old license, doing that dang old curveball, man.
It's like a goddamn sandy cofax, man.
Yeah, I guess I forgot all about the bill that Bill used to be.
How to kick my own ass.
You know the real surprise here is that those poor lies could ever have survived off your cold, cold blood.
Dr. Milford, be straight with me.
What have I got?
It's a heart murmur.
Tune in tomorrow.
Oh, no!
Ow, what happened?
It's a heart murmur.
No, come on, fellas.
You got to be patient now.
Man, Jill was a lot less fun before you got here.
William Doe Tree, top of your court appearance.
William Doe Tree, $50 fine.
Don't do it again.
You're free to go.
Pay on your way out.
Excuse me, your honor.
What if I don't pay the fine?
If you can't pay, you spend two days in jail.
I'm not paying.
What?
Whatever.
Two days in jail.
Thank you.
Bill, what the heck are you doing?
What do you want?
Did you come to mock me?
No, Bill, I came to help.
Well, you're a little late.
I'm hanging up on you like you did to me.
I might stay here longer than two days.
I'll commit another crime.
Hell, I'll tell them I'm the North Side burglar.
They'll lock me up and throw away the key.
They'll show you.
Come on, Bill, you're being crazy.
Bayliff, escort me home, please.
Hey, I got an idea.
You tell the guys back in the cell I got electrocuted.
Then I'll jump out and surprise them.
Bill!
Bill, no way!
Bill!
Officer, I demand to see Bill Dothriev immediately.
If necessary, I'll be happy to fill out the proper paperwork.
Mr. Dothriev is refusing to see visitors.
He was quite specific.
I am not leaving this station until I get to see my friend.
Sir, we really don't do threats around here.
Bill!
Bill, I need to talk to you!
Go away!
Yeah!
Go away!
Who are you?
Who are you?
Now get lost!
We're busy.

You know, the fat bald guy in the t-shirt wants to confess to all those burglaries on the north side.
Really?
So Hollywood Dogtree wants to start doing some hard time.
Peggy, don't save dinner for me tonight.
I'll explain everything later.
But right now, I'm afraid I have to break the law.
you
I believe I am in violation of the law.
Go ahead and arrest me.
Uh, sir, that's not officially a law.
Ah, it's just store policy, but I don't enforce it.
I'm not even wearing shoes back here.
You scratch the bumper sticker from my daughter's school.
Check this.
Hey, brother.
Yeah, the guards let me have a tape recorder in here.
You want to hear what your confetion would sound like just for fun?
I appreciate that.
I just don't want it to sound too rehearsed.
Bill, Bill.
Hey, Bill.
Nank, what are you doing here?
I came to help you.
Don't confess.
Well, why should some criminal get to go to jail and make me go back to my lousy life without any friends?
I'm your friend, Bill.
Prove it.
Prove it?
I've been your friend for 25 years.
Who talked you out of buying the houseboat?
Who kept you from killing yourself after Lenore left you?
Who listens to you for hours after you've had a nightmare?
And I'm happy to do it because we're friends.
Heck, I even got myself arrested just so I could talk to you.
Huh.
Yeah, and it turns out I also had your name tattooed on the back of my head.
Really?
Let me see it!
Uh, actually, I just kinda had it removed.
Very painful process.
Not because it wasn't a great tattoo, but- God, I want to confess!
Oh, dang.
Uh, sir, do you think I could have a moment of your time?
Gosh, that's smarts.
If you want, I could frame it in barbed wire.
Or snakes.
Bill, hey, Bill.
Now what?
You, uh, you still got that mirror?
Well, you look at that.
I especially like the smiley face over the eye.
Wow.
That must have been incredibly painful.
Yep.
Yep.
Looks like you're out early on good behavior.
If good behavior is a factor here, I cleaned the toilets and made the beds.
Sit down, Baldi.
Your court date's not till noon.
Well, fellas, looks like this is it.
Oh, jeez.
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry, but look at me now.
Hey, if you want, I can get myself locked up again to keep you company till noon.
No, no.
You've paid your debt to Society Bill.
Now I'll pay mine.
Okay then.
Okay.
Uh, Mr. Dottrieve, uh, you're free to go.
Uh, that's okay.
I'm waiting for a friend.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
