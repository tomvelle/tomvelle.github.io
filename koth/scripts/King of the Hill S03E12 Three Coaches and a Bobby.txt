Bobby looks pretty good in that uniform.
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Think the Cougars have a chance this year?
No.
Nope.
Paint.
Boys, the welten wolves have already put their mark on this bridge.
Now what does a cougar do when a wolf comes into his neck of the woods?
Beats him in football.
Yeah, that's where I was gonna end up, Bobby.
Now, you Cougars can't be winners until you act like winners.
And winners paint bridges.
Here you go, winner.
Boys, the important thing to remember is you're from Arlen, and Arlen once had a great team.
We were behind but too, but luckily we had the finest strategist ever to come out of Heimlich County, Coach Whitey Sowers.
Now how are we going to win state if we don't get to state?
Now go out there and get me to state.
You get us to state and I guarantee I'll kiss each and every one of you little pansies right on the mouth.
Let's go!
Down, down, set.
Well, that man look like a dang ol' blitz, man.
Don't change plans, man.
If they hand off the hand, come around, blitz, fake reverse, leave it, run down on the head, hey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh!
We did it!
We did it!
We're going to stake!
Damn that man could coach.
How romantic.
What?
That mom was there and she saw you make that play.
And then, right after the game, she canceled her date with that guy who ended up building all those airports.
Just paint the dang bridge.
Yeah, good play.
Way to go.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We need to blitz more!
I haven't done my sack dance all day!
Settle down, Bobby.
That's the kind of attitude that drove Mark Gastonot into boxing.
Do not just stand there scratching, Coach Maxwell!
You are not going to find a good play up there!
Maxwell, you suck!
Now, Wendy, honey, that is over the line.
You need specific criticism, not just generalities.
Maxwell, your play sucks!
Wingo Interception, Joseph!
That's our boy, a real all-American, Arlen's native son.
Heads up!
Sorry, the ball got away there.
Coach Coleman Lucas, the wind.
Uh, excuse me, could you face the other way or something when you do that?
We got a real sport going on here.
It's called football.
Actually, in the rest of the world, soccer is called football.
You should try it.
Soccer or football is excellent physical conditioning.
What's the point?
Anyone can kick the ball under the goal.
No, not if the goalie has anything to say about it.
He tries to stop them.
But don't worry, it's all in good fun.
Two minutes?
Oh my god, we could win this thing!
Well, alright.
Uh, two minutes.
Who hasn't played yet?
Uh, Bobby Hill!
Get in there!
Coach, you can't put me in now!
We can win this!
Hank, he's putting your boy in!
I'm on it.
It's just bad strategy!
Uh, hey coach, Bobby's been cheering awfully hard today and I'm afraid he might have worn himself out already, eh?
Hank, you know I like to play every player at least two minutes a game.
Can't you just let him play four minutes next game?
Bobby!
Mittens, honey!
Do not put Bobby in if outcome of the game can be affected in any way.
There.
Coach Maxwell, I... and some of the parents... You suck!
Now, hold on.
What we have here are some suggestions.
No, Dale's right.
He does suck.
You're not being paid to screw up.
I'm not being paid at all.
In fact, I still haven't been reimbursed for last week's pizzas.
Oh, and if you guys aren't too busy, could you please just go to hell?
Dale, what did you do with last week's pizza money?
I bought a hat.
You know who would have won that game?
Coach Sowers.
Yeah.
You know who would have not played Bobby?
Coach Sowers.
Yeah.
Coach Sowers, man.
And you know who we should get?
The Coach Bobby's team?
Coach Sowers.
That's a gribble of an idea, Bill.
All right.
Coach Sowers is what it is.
If those are tight in the toes, I'll get your half size bigger.
Coach Sowers?
Hill!
Finally got a haircut!
Heh heh, you noticed.
Boom-Hauer!
How you folks?
Man, I do.
Fine.
Man, I'm down on Florida.
Man, I'm gonna ladder winter.
Man, I did no problems, man.
Sorry to hear that.
Gribble!
No one's killed you yet.
Don't leave!
My God, man!
What happened?
It's a long story.
Do you remember?
Coach, we came by to see you because... Well, because you're the best coach Arlen has ever seen.
How would you like to coach again for my son's football team?
Coach again?
I quit!
Whoa, it's not really a paying job.
Thank you, sir.
I don't know what I'm doing in this bed.
I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
Well, thank you, you devil.
I'm just so excited that Bobby's gonna have the Coach Sauer's experience.
I only hope working at the mall hadn't knocked the fight out of him.
I don't know, honey.
That man could be a tough taskmaster.
Let's not forget that you used to call him Sauer Coach Sauer's.
Remember?
Yeah.
Boy, we came up with that one at a fellowship of Christian athletes picnic.
Sour coach sours.
We were good kids though.
He's a real high school football coach.
He's tough as nails, but you're gonna love him.
Fellas, my name is Coach Sowers, and I took Arlen Hyde as state in 1974.
Wow!
Up to now you may have been losing, but now you're going to be winning.
Because I'm going to ride you, little Danny Joe, so hard you wish you were all dead.
I'm going to chew you up, spit you out, take a big dump on top of that, and then I'm going to get tough.
Let's rub him up.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Okay, you kids have fun.
Eat much!
I said eat it!
Eat it!
Coach, I think I swallowed too much mud.
Take a salt tablet.
I'm walking in biscuit dough.
Memorize it.
That looks like fun.
Salt tablet.
You call that a pass?
Give me that ball or I'll slice your guts out hippie.
Run!
One Jubby Jack.
Two Jubby Jacks.
Full extension.
Very nice.
Any more of you ladies want to join him?
Anyone else?
Any more?
Alright, that's enough.
Hey, Butterball, drag the body back.
What's that on your upper arm there, Bobby?
Is that a muscle?
No, that's a lump from when I got hit by a football.
You know, Dad, the kids playing soccer don't have any lumps or bruises.
And Coach Lucas gives them oranges at halftime.
Bobby, I didn't think I'd ever need to tell you this, but I would be a bad parent if I didn't.
Soccer was invented by European ladies to keep them busy while their husbands did the cooking.
Why do you have to hate what you don't understand?
I don't hate you, Bobby.
I meant soccer.
Oh, oh yeah, I hate soccer, yes.
Well, there you are, Hill.
Now, where's Butterball?
Uh, Butterball?
Hey, Dad.
Uh, hey there, Bobby.
Are you planning on loosening up our football team with some comedy soccer skits or something?
Bobby Hill, time for stepkick drills.
Sorry, Dad.
Break your heart, doesn't it?
Take a soft, tablet.
Just when Coach Sowers was fixing to get those kids a victory, Bobby leaves sports and joins a soccer team.
Did Joseph leave too?
No.
The team will survive, Hank.
Yeah, it's a terrible blow to morale, of course, but...
Honey, I'm taking Bobby to soccer practice.
You going to soccer practice dressed like that?
Oh, no, Piggy here.
Get real.
You'll borrow my nice sweater.
Well, thank you, men, but it is not that cold out.
Believe me, it's freezing cold if you not take sweater.
Well, in that case, I have a perfectly good flannel over-shirt.
OK, you know better.
Woo-hoo!
Way to go, the wind!
Way to kick that ball downfield!
Thanks for the latte, Allie.
Uh, baking.
What a pretty over shirt.
Oh, thank you.
And what a pretty sweater.
You're all wearing.
Well, well, well, what do we got here?
A soccer money.
Look, Coach, I just want to apologize for Bobby quitting on you like that.
I know you spent a lot of money, Xerox, in these playbooks.
It's the correlating.
That's where they screw you.
If you really feel bad for the way Butterball screwed me, you can be my assistant football coach.
I don't know.
With Bobby not on the team, it might make him feel... Okay, Louisa May.
Go play your ballerina ball.
Just leave your pants in the bucket.
Well, uh... I guess I could find a little time to... Memorize it!
I tell you, Peggy, the football team might go all the way this year.
I sure am sorry you're not gonna be a part of that, Bobby.
Although you could be.
I can't.
The soccer team needs me.
I'm one of the nine co-captains.
Bobby, I think your father would like to do something you both like to do together, huh?
Movie?
Maybe you two could see a movie together.
Sir, a movie?
Why don't you set it up through Mom?
I'm a little tight.
I gotta go stretch my hands.
Cashmere sweater with pearl button.
Now they like you.
Oh, it's just a sweater.
If the other mothers do not like me for the wit and wisdom that is Peggy Hill, then I want nothing to do with them.
You not get it.
You soccer mom now.
If you not fit in, then Bobby not fit in.
That boy have enough problem.
How do you know so much about this?
Connie play AYSO in Orange County.
That's the birthplace of soccer moms.
I start the whole sweater thing.
That's mine.
Tie game!
Everyone's a winner!
You know, I was thinking of bringing Bobby to watch the Wolves rematch, you know, just as my guess.
Oh, Butterball?
Butterball is dead to me.
Go!
Scoop of vanilla for everyone!
We won a game without having to beat anyone, and then we practiced high kicks.
Watch.
Ewww!
Bobby's our best high kicker.
Careful don't let the Rockettes find out about him.
The Rockets?
Me?
Codes of conduct.
Cheer all good plays.
Respect every player as if he, she were on your team.
And what is this he, she?
Some kind of a science fiction deal?
You don't get it, do you?
We're their coaches.
But we're the ones who are learning.
And these kids are pretty good teachers.
All we have to do is listen.
Now let's get going, gang.
We don't want to be late for a cleanup project.
Uh, wait a minute, Bobby.
Uh, I'm sorry, Lucas.
I thought I'd take my boy to see that new space movie.
I hear it's got special effects.
Sorry, Dad.
Gotta go.
The one who collects the most litter gets to play goalie mix gang.
The space movie with Julia Louis-Drivers?
You know what this team needs?
Tradition.
Rivalry.
We could go and paint the bridge.
Great idea, Robert.
We'll cover up all that device of graffiti.
But my dad's rematch against the wolves isn't until tomorrow.
The wolves haven't even seen it yet.
And if we all work together as a team, they never will.
This is one time when the wind used their hands.
Coach Sowers, I think there's something wrong with my helmet.
Then get over there and do the helmet chest.
Put on the helmet and run into that brick wall.
Yeah, right.
And end up with headaches like my mom.
You're going the wrong way.
Hey, put your helmet back on.
All right, you big baby.
I'll do it.
Ow!
What the?
You little panty-watch think you're ready to play the wolves again?
The wolves eat razor blades for breakfast!
Run!
You bunch of pudgy-butted softies!
Run with your fancy sneakers with the bumps and valves and little lights on the back that can set off a seizure!
But what do you care?
I ran around the world and a pair of Chuck Taylor's for the love of Pete!
What in God's name is going on here?
Dammit, I never did like you, Hill.
You were a know-it-all and a do-gooder, and your teeny, tiny, weak little girly ankle bone snapped in the finals, and you lost me state!
I lost you state?
I'm the one who got you to state.
I wish I never dragged you out of that shoe store.
Are we done yet?
Well, you precious little candy-ass.
I think you heard him.
Hit him again to make sure.
What do we do, Assistant Coach Hill?
We're playing the Wolves on Saturday and we don't have Joseph.
Or your kid.
Haven't you kids ever seen Rudy?
A little fire plug of a never say quit at Notre Dame?
He died of cancer after the big game, I think.
All right, hands in the middle.
God bless America on three.
One, two, three, go.
Yeah, well, I wish you had a woman too, Bill.
Hold on.
Hill residents.
Hank, Coleman Lucas.
Just need your fax number so I can fax over Bobby's soccer diet.
We don't have a fax or a fax number.
Oh, well, just give me your email address and I'll attach it.
Yeah, it's football is great.
Soccer is dumb.com.
Goodbye.
Hey, hey, hey!
Peggy, that's a lovely sweater.
Well, you see, you don't have to look dumpy at a soccer match.
Which one's your son?
Well, my husband, Henry, is bringing him in the truck.
Oh, wait, you mean his sports utility vehicle, not a pickup truck?
Well, yes.
It's red.
Beat those wolves, Dad!
Sure, sure, and you have a good soccer game.
Beat those fluffy puffs or whatever.
Dad, they're called the puffin' stuffs.
Good, get a good stretch.
Extend.
I know it's bigger than the other SUVs, but it makes me feel safe.
I mean, if I have an accident in that thing, I'm going to live.
I'm here for my son.
I am here for my son.
Well, for me, it's all about convenience.
Mine's got everything from headlight wipers to heated seats.
Oh, well, that is a must, isn't it?
You know, my butt is always either warmed by my car seat or covered by my sweater.
I have to keep it at optimum temperature or I could die from mild discomfort.
Yeah.
And you know what else would just make me die?
If by mistake, I paid so much attention to my child's game that I maybe raised my voice.
Huh?
Oh, I would just die, I would.
Or if I got stuck with a bunch of losers who couldn't recognize a dead-on perfect, fat Albert impression, well, I would just die a thousand deaths.
You know what?
I have got a football game to watch.
Well, that would be men's.
Go, Joseph!
Go!
Slow down, Joseph.
We've already got the tie.
We don't have to hurt anyone's feelings.
Why don't we just give them a dang ball?
Screw it.
No hands.
You're not the goalie.
Come on, y'all.
We were all Cougars once.
We're getting our butts kicked over there.
I, for one, have had enough of this dang lawyer ball.
Haven't you?
Coach, I'm here if you need me.
Bobby?
I'd rather be on a losing football team than a winning soccer team any day.
Well, all right, son.
You're back.
And I brought Joseph with me.
All right, Bobby.
Way to go, son.
Get in there.
Split right.
Buttonhook on two.
That was good strategy bringing Joseph back, Bobby.
Stick with it, and you could make a good coach someday.
Hmm.
I'd still want to wear my uniform.
Uh, yeah, okay.
And a cape.
Woohoo!
Alright, go Cougars!
Go Cougars!
Kick some wolf tail!
Well, well, well.
Peggy Hill coming back to football.
Uh, Wendy.
Toss me a beer.
Take a salt tablet.
