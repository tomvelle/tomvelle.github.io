Boy, I tell you what, Chappy.
You've got some good-looking trees this year.
Is that a dig?
Because it ain't funny, Hank.
I wasn't trying to be funny at all.
Oh, sorry, Hank.
But people ain't buying trees this year.
They're buying batteries and bottled water.
It's the millennium, Hank.
That's crazy.
Everyone's known about the millennium for almost a year now.
You know, I have on good authority from Texas Propane Association Commissioner Murray Hogarth, personal friend, that there will be no disruption of essential services.
Well, I'm not panicking.
You want to know why?
Because Chappie takes care of Chappie.
Want a piece of cornbread?
Make it myself with no electric tools.
Hmm.
Must be the elbow grease makes it taste so good, huh?
That or the lord, render it myself.
You're like a pioneer, Chappy.
I live in a shack.
I poop in an outhouse.
I eat what I kill.
Let the grit go down, lord.
I don't need it.
There isn't a Mrs. Chappy as there, Chappy.
I tell you what, man, I'm Y2K, man, and all my main friends are gonna come crashing down on that grid, man.
I like it, they're gonna pop lifts now, man.
The horror.
The horror.
Oh, Lord Dale.
You know this Y2K thing is tailor-made for paranoid freaks like him.
Gentlemen, sorry I'm late, but I had a fantastic day.
I went to the Army Navy store.
Ah, what'd you buy?
A battleship?
No, Hank, don't be a silly.
Well, I bought an American flag decal.
It signifies my full faith and confidence in the United States government in these trying and uncertain times.
Well, it's taken 2,000 years, but Dale, you're finally making sense.
Team USA!
That's the four sacks of seed corn.
18 Cases Breakfast Bars Strawberry 18 Cases Breakfast Bars Assorted 2 CO2 Pressurized Drums of Mountain Dew Shug No one's gonna catch the big D off guard The real problem will be obtaining fresh meat A breeding pair of gerboles Um, Dale, honey One of those is a hamster
Laugh now, lady.
After a month of eating cockroaches, you will be begging for Jerbster.
Okie dokie, how's this one?
Although there is no L in Christmas, there is no L in Christmas.
Oh, I see.
The second one is N-O-E-L.
That's a different word.
That is very funny, Mom.
Well... Hey, who wants to go to Megalo Mart and buy some tinsel?
Peggy?
Tinsel?
There's a run on triple ply bunny soft!
What about quilted aloe vera?
I don't know.
It's not my brand.
Well, it's my brand!
Bobby, you're not all hepped up on this Y2K ho-ha, are you?
I just saw our man wheel in 300 rolls of triple ply and it made me uneasy.
That man is a nut job.
Oh, he's no nutjob.
I used to work for Dell Computer.
I know things.
Dell Computer.
Excuse me, but I have a K-Pro.
Now, can you tell me if it will be Y2K compliant?
K-Pro?
My watch has more memory than that piece of crap.
You know what I think, Dad?
Nutjob.
Peggy, I need your help.
I need hard copies.
I could lose everything, Hank.
Everything.
Seven letter boggle words, my Peggy Hill self abridged thesaurus, musings, ponderings on the way to being musings, rap music, rapping paper.
I know I can crack that nut.
Piggy, why don't you take off that nasal strip?
Maybe your snoring will drown out the sound of that dang printer.
Do not blame me!
Blame the freaking millennium!
Oh no!
My opinion!
Hey, Dale, you own a computer, don't you?
I have a system.
Well, I'm going to surprise Peggy this year.
I'm going to get her a new computer.
A computer?
I mean, a computer.
It's a shame to see all our friends and neighbors acting so selfish.
Fred Nicholson cut an old lady off yesterday in the checkout line.
The JV basketball coach.
Greedy.
I mean, if everyone hoards, there will be nothing left to go around.
And he who does hoard will have unreasonable power.
You and I seem to be the only ones around here that have our heads on straight.
Completely straight.
The machines are down for compliance testing.
Oh, hold the phone.
Wack-a-mole is up and running.
Of course it's running.
There's no computer in your Wack-a-mole game.
It's a basic peg and gear system with a simple servo motor controlling each rodent.
They don't make them like this.
Hank!
Found one!
Now, hold on, Dale.
I want to make sure it's Y2K compliant because Peggy's K-Pro, evidently, is not.
K-Pro?
That wasn't Y1K compliant.
All home computers are Y2K compliant now, but the mainframes.
If people would spend a little less time worrying and a little more time reading a brilliantly written op-ed piece by former FCC chairman Reed Hunt, then they'd realize that our government has everything under control.
I'd like to read that article, Dale, and I'll take that computer, the gray one.
Shoot.
Our system is down.
I can't ring you up.
Well, just write me out a receipt.
Sir, the computer is down.
I can't sell you a computer.
I can't check our inventory.
I can't lock the front door.
It's impossible to figure out the sales tax.
It's 8%.
Yes, and 8 is a key on the computer.
Hey, Spaggy.
Where's Hank?
Hank?
He went someplace.
I can't tell you.
He went Christmas shopping, didn't he?
So I moved all the combs to the lower drawer, which was practically empty.
And now it's base wide policy.
Yeah.
So all the barbers at Fort Blanda.
Tell me the part about what Hank is getting me for Christmas.
Hmm.
A computer.
Anyway.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So I remember I said I'd tell you about the brushes.
Peggy.
Peggy.
You had her with the combs.
Shug, I'll be in my think hole.
My do!
How could you do this to me, puff puff?
My cigarettes!
No!
Well, I hope you took your heart pills this morning, Mr. Strickland, because it looks like it's going to be a rough one.
No, not me, Hank.
There's a lynch mob out there that's gone wide too kooky.
I'm out of here.
Sir, have you forgotten the gassers creed?
I promise to dispense... No, no, no, I don't have time for that.
They'll be in me going to the desert to ride out to the apocalypse.
They'll be back in two weeks.
Don't worry, we've got plenty of propane to go around.
Hey, Joe Jack, what do you got left in the tanks?
Tanks are topped out.
We got nothing.
What?
But we were supposed to get a shipment in this morning.
Okay, it's officially an emergency.
I'm gonna put a call in to Texas propane commissioner Murray Hogarth.
You'll have a bobtail here in no time.
Murray Hogarth, please.
Oh hi Murray, Hank Hill calling.
My supplier left me holding the... What?
But you promised me there are procedures in place.
What does this have to do with Y2K?
What does temporarily non-compliant mean?
Murray, stop crying.
Act like a commissioner for God's sake.
So, where's our propane?
Uh, nothing to panic about, okay?
I've got some extra tanks in the back, so if you'll just form a line, single file, please.
That's it.
Okay.
There are procedures in place.
Procedures.
Procedures.
Forgive me, Lord, for what I'm about to do.
Hank's getting me a new computer for Christmas.
Well, I think it's romantic.
Did it make the news?
Did what make the news?
Over at work, but Murray Hogarth was crying.
Peggy, this computer thing could be big.
You were right to be worried.
Well, I am more than worried, Hank.
I am panicked.
I am panicked that my old computer is going to drag this family down into the depths of chaos.
Yeah, let's get rid of that old computer.
Oh, right.
Exactly, I agree.
Let's get rid of that old computer, shall we?
Oh, he is such a bad actor.
Let's again!
Ah, Dale, thank goodness.
Everyone else is losing their minds.
You're the only... Shut up!
I don't have time for your little problems.
My gerbil screwed me.
What?
I'm ruined.
All of the planning and the secret hoarding.
You've been hoarding?
Duh!
I need foodstuffs.
What do you got?
I have got nothing for a liar like you.
You've got three tanks of propane.
How did you know that?
Hank, I have dedicated my life to getting ahead of others in times of crisis.
This is my time.
Fine, it's your time, so what do we do?
I have no idea.
Alright, you're gonna need your own wheat grinder.
I'll teach you how to grow your own mung beans in old paper towels.
I live in a shack and I poop in an outhouse.
That's it!
This is your go-to, guy!
An outhouse in monkey beans!
I couldn't take on the freakin' Bicentennial with an outhouse in monkey beans, let alone the millennium!
Is that a dig?
You listen to me, climp-cadittle hopper.
You listen good.
1.2 trillion lines of lethal software code!
Yeah, and 30 billion embedded microchips!
All going down!
Utilities will fail, nuclear weapons will launch themselves!
Quit whining.
Hold on.
Don't cut me out.
We could work as a team, right?
All right.
I'll take care of tools and supplies.
You guys are in charge of food.
Try to stay focused.
Now I know that your mom wants a computer for Christmas, but she'll thank me come January 1st when this is the only gift on the block that'll work.
And when that grid goes down, you know what's gonna happen?
I don't know what a grid is.
Exactly, nobody does.
And they certainly won't know what time it is, and that's when they'll be knocking on our door asking to use our clock.
What happened to your power drill?
It's gone.
Got rid of it.
Traded it to a fool for a sack of corn.
We've only got six days to stock up on aloe vera quilted toilet paper.
I'll get the truck.
Shush.
Let me handle this.
My friend Chappy and I both have wives for whom we are looking for presents.
Christmas dogs to put under the tree.
How about this lasso up, sir?
No, that's way too small.
Well, let's see.
This one's old and kind of ropey.
My wife would not enjoy it.
Maybe you two should step away from the cages.
Please, my wife is in the wheelchair.
All she wants for Christmas is a big fat dode with lots of meat on his honches.
I'll take all nine of those little dogs on top.
Wrap them up.
We have Christmas!
Have we lost power?
Don't know, but when we do, we'll be ready.
Okay, Bobby.
Honey, why don't you get us started?
I love it!
Well, you did drop some pretty big hints.
All right, who's next?
Me, me, me!
Oh!
Oh, thanks.
Um...
Yeah, thanks.
Careful, Luan.
They don't call it a mangle for nothing.
It's a laundry mangle.
For a white Christmas.
That's four thousand sheets.
Thank you, Bobby.
Well, I got you a disc, man.
And Uncle Hank, I got you a pair of Timberland boots.
And I got toilet paper and a laundry mangle.
Peggy, your turn.
Is it bigger than a mouse pad?
Well, why don't you go find out?
It's in your office.
That is not a computer.
No, it's a strawm well from 1910.
I do not want a grandfather clock.
And I do not want toilet paper.
Fine.
I'll take the grandfather clock.
It's a great grandfather clock.
I'll bet you're ready for the Millennium Coach Landry.
You won 270 games and all you needed was one suit and one hat and that one expression.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hank, I am taking Bobby and the WAN to get real presents.
Oh, and I'm going to be driving a car if that's okay with you.
Are you guys crazy?
Don't stick your heads out there, you'll get clacked!
We're Peggy!
I'm gonna get a computer!
Ow!
Bobby!
Bobby Moe!
I'm wearing diapers, father.
What?
I'm going backwards.
I'm a baby man.
The future is bad.
You said so yourself.
No, you can't let that happen.
Up and down.
Join the party.
Join the party.
Up and down.
This is insanity.
Keep your heads down.
Tom Landry?
Hello, Hank.
Coach Landry, you've got to get off the platform.
It's a peg and gear.
In a couple of seconds, it's going to push you through that hole.
I know.
But aren't you scared?
You're going to get whacked.
Not every time, Hank.
The times you don't, it's pretty sweet.
Sunshine, fresh air, a little football on the TV in the arcade.
Every time I go up, I see a little more.
Well, my turn again.
Cowboys are playing.
Outta boy, Trite.
Come on, Bobby, it'll be all right.
Coach Landry said so.
No, I like it here.
It's safe, and it's quilted.
Bobby, come with me.
Everything is gonna be just fine.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Dad, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
We're all gonna be okay.
What are you doing?
Bobby, trust me.
I want to apologize to everyone for almost ruining Christmas.
There really is nothing to be afraid of about this millennium.
Heck, the year 2000 only happens once in the history of man and we're darn lucky to see it happen.
Peggy, do you remember how excited you were when you rolled over the odometer in your Buick?
Well, imagine if the whole world had been in that car with you.
Oh, Hank, honey, don't.
Don't burn the clock.
You know, the more I see it, the more I think it makes me look like an intellectual.
Uh, actually, Peggy, I got you a real Christmas present.
A system?
Really?
A blueberry one.
It'll be here tomorrow.
Oh, Hank.
Hey, here, Billy.
Those on logs, you know.
Yeah, they for wiping, wiping.
You will be begging for Jerbster.
