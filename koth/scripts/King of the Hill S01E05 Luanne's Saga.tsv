36835	37756	Just two more.
37896	38557	Come on.
39018	40019	Okay.
40039	40900	Five more.
40960	41200	Okay.
42021	42662	Five more.
42702	45045	Hey, you said two.
45325	46727	You can't predict this tape.
47127	48229	I've done it enough to know.
49110	50471	My Game Boy's out of batteries.
50772	52154	I need to get on the Nintendo.
52534	52834	Quick!
53195	54136	Just a minute, Bobby.
54997	57961	Get ready to turn and turn.
60223	61345	Way to go, Bobby.
63808	64969	Hi, Uncle Hank.
65354	66656	Uh, shut that off.
67497	70020	Bobby, stop dancing now.
70481	72003	He is not just dancing.
72304	74567	He's firming his thighs and tightening his buttocks.
74767	75568	Watch your mouth.
77871	78332	Jesus.
78352	78993	Ah!
79013	79594	Ah!
79614	80475	Jack!
80916	81597	Lou Anne!
82037	82798	Ah, damn it.
83519	85542	Ah, look at this place.
85562	86884	What is it, Uncle Hank?
86904	89688	The sofa beds in the out position.
90389	92712	And I can't find nothing in here anymore.
92860	93922	What are you looking for?
93942	96927	I didn't used to have to be looking for something.
97448	99471	I'd come into my den and just look.
99752	103158	Look at my different stuff and get ideas about what I want.
103418	104580	Don't worry, Uncle Hank.
104640	105762	I'll be out of your hair soon.
105782	109008	I think Buckley's gonna ask me to move in.
109669	110190	Isn't it neat?
111192	114397	I'll be going from daddy to you to Buckley.
114778	117282	Yeah, it's an amazing journey, Lou Ann.
117548	118893	What about this?
118913	120399	Maybe you want this record?
120741	122367	No, it doesn't work like that.
122628	124275	How about this tackle box?
124295	128773	Luanne, what did I just... Well, that might need reorganizing.
140228	143152	Why do you let Luan go out with that hairball?
143172	144193	It's none of my business.
144473	145475	She's not my daughter.
146236	149960	Anyway, that Buckley may be dumb as dirt, but he's her ticket out of my house.
159352	159993	Keep going!
160033	163317	They should be out of my sight by now.
168123	184444	And, man, in Dangle Birds, man, flying low this season, man, it's probably a dangle awkward, man, to take a look.
184464	185805	What the hell was that?
186426	187728	That was a breakup.
188609	191953	At least that's what it was the last time I ran into the house crying.
195410	208386	A lot of tears.
209968	211490	Guess what was on sale?
211971	213233	Oh, my lord, you've been dumped.
213253	217278	Oh, there, there.
217298	223105	All right, you tell Aunt Peggy all about it.
231455	241087	Fish sticks?
243991	244711	Oh.
246053	248296	Hey, you know, I was almost killed at this point.
248316	249177	Okay, Hank, please.
249217	250799	Try and be sensitive.
253683	254464	Okay, honey.
254484	255585	Go ahead, you let it out.
256006	257167	It is natural.
257187	258829	This is the healing process.
260632	265098	Peggy.
265559	266680	I had a talk with her today.
266721	270746	We are past the first hump, so that leaves only seven more humps.
271187	272869	Peggy, I need you to fix her now.
273370	277175	Without my quiet time, I'm not an effective propane salesman.
277335	278998	Well, you can't rush it, Hank.
279018	284005	The formula is, for however long she was dating him, that's how long it takes to get over him.
284145	286488	You mean we got three more weeks of this?
286849	289272	If you don't fix her, I'll have to.
289252	292136	Well, honey, I don't think you have the tools for that job.
292296	293398	What's that supposed to mean?
293939	298686	Well, remember when my aunt died and you kept grabbing me around the waist and saying, let's wrestle.
298986	300508	Yeah, but you told me that helped you.
300909	301210	I did.
301650	302652	Well, yes, it did.
303072	303353	See?
303813	308120	Look, if you really want to help, sometime tomorrow you tell Louie and she looks pretty.
308420	310203	What's that got to do with anything?
310343	312166	She just needs to hear it from a man.
312486	316592	Three words, you look pretty and nothing more.
317737	319821	So whatcha thinkin' about there, Stu?
320081	322245	I'm thinkin' about flippin' that steak there.
322606	323187	Well, ratty.
323547	323968	No!
324148	325190	Flip that other one!
325551	328856	Don't go away.
328876	336790	We'll be right back with more of Make a Steak.
336810	337672	How you doin' out there?
337932	338954	I'm Chuck Manjoni.
339495	342360	You know, even celebrities have to hunt for bargains.
342509	346893	That's why I go to the Megalomark, where shopping feels so good.
347493	351777	This week, twelve five pound bags of gourmet chocolates for ten dollars.
352258	372195	That's Buckley's section.
372935	374056	You look pretty.
374797	375778	I was dumped.
377279	378821	Three words, nothing more.
379141	380362	You look pretty.
380883	381584	Nothing more.
382124	384607	Why aren't you saying anything?
387089	388591	I never liked that Buckley.
389011	389872	You should be happy.
390432	393395	That guy was an annoying greasy headed loser.
394016	397980	I was dumped by a loser.
399715	401897	Ah, jeez.
401917	405281	Luanne, sometimes life throws you a curveball.
405301	407223	Now there's two ways you can deal with it.
407784	414351	You can cry, and that's the path you've chosen, or you can not cry.
414391	416854	How do you not cry?
416874	421639	Well, instead of letting it out, try holding it in.
422520	428507	Every time you have a feeling, just stick it into a little pit inside your stomach and never let it out.
432065	434809	Are you supposed to have a pain under your rib?
435069	435430	Yes.
436111	437012	That's natural.
437413	440257	The body doesn't want to swallow its emotions.
440858	444242	But now you go ahead and put that pain inside your stomach, too.
444903	446546	I think it's working, Uncle Hank.
447627	450251	I feel sick, but not sad.
450591	451212	There you go.
451272	453175	Look at my friend Bill.
453235	458022	He went through the worst divorce this county's ever seen, but you never see him crying.
460246	468720	I'm scared I'll never find another guy.
469080	470142	Ah, don't worry about that.
470683	471344	Peggy told me.
471945	476192	If you dated your old boyfriend for three weeks, you'll get a new one in three weeks.
476452	477073	Tops.
478032	484681	Another thing I hate about Buckley, he always takes me to all you can eat and says that I have to sneak off his plate so I just get iced tea.
485362	487284	And then he's too scared to get caught to share.
487585	489828	Ooh, I hate guys like that.
490148	493072	And why do boys with braces always want a french kiss?
494434	498860	Uh, pass me some more of that cookie dough.
502525	502605	Mmm.
503277	504841	I never knew you could eat it raw.
505502	507046	It's almost as good as ice cream.
507407	510595	You know they make ice cream with cookie dough already in it.
510615	516409	Damn sister get me my keys.
517250	518331	Lou Ann, where have you been?
518351	520374	We were supposed to be crying all night.
520614	522536	I spent the whole day with Uncle Hank.
522756	525780	Lou Ann, why don't you go get the fold out ready?
526120	526521	OK.
526921	528563	Good night, Uncle Hank and Aunt Peggy.
529004	530145	Good night, Hank.
530225	531026	What did you do?
531046	533048	I did what you couldn't do.
533088	535892	Now, I'm not saying you're not good at what you do.
535952	537553	I'm just saying I'm better.
538214	540917	I went in there and fixed her like fixing a carburetor.
541398	542039	And you know what?
542139	544962	It was fun, like fixing a carburetor.
544942	546926	But Hank, I told you not to meddle.
547447	551214	This is a natural process and you cannot manipulate... You know, you look pretty.
552216	552536	Really?
553879	554600	Oh, Hank.
555161	556043	Well, that's sweet.
557005	559429	But I mean it, you have got to stop... You look pretty, Peg.
560972	561533	Oh, thank you.
572887	574129	You ladies go on ahead.
574169	576293	We gotta help Bill close his jeans.
578217	579559	All right, let's go.
579579	582745	All right, we have to find a nice boyfriend for Lou Ann.
583306	586592	Boy, that seems like a pile of work just to get your den back.
586872	588455	Well, it's not about my den.
588515	591040	It's about that poor girl living in my den.
591681	592903	So what's your type?
600038	602200	Uh, never mind about her type.
602320	603882	Just find a regular guy.
604263	608107	It's a scientific fact that women like round muscular butts.
608567	611630	I'm gonna look for a guy with a round muscular butt.
613472	615515	Uh, maybe we should split up.
616295	617176	Oh, one more thing.
617717	618998	Peggy doesn't know about this.
619479	620700	Oh, you want me to tell her?
621681	622322	No, Bill.
622943	623824	Just dance with her.
624144	625185	Keep her busy.
625503	626585	What, me?
627046	627767	Dancing?
627787	629851	I don't know, I don't know.
630412	643275	My arms around a warm, okay.
644577	645038	Hmm.
648324	648685	Nah.
648865	648945	Hmm.
650191	650792	Possible.
651472	652914	Dale, I bought you a beer.
653474	654695	Mind if I dance with your wife?
655116	655516	Take her.
659140	659560	Sucker.
660201	662523	Y'all know, man, he ain't gonna have to worry about that.
662543	664725	If you go out and dance, she's gonna go Dutch, man.
664745	666087	Something to know of the way.
666107	667248	Well, you smell nice.
667949	669670	Dance with me, sugar?
669690	670831	Hey, boy, take what, man?
670851	672473	That ain't over CK1, man.
672493	676497	It's like catnip.
676517	679540	Hey, you seem like a regular guy.
684633	686618	Hi, what's Hank doing over there?
686638	688924	Well, I don't see him.
688944	691651	Bill, why are you spinning me into souvenir gold?
692133	694058	Been a while, I can't remember all the steps.
694358	696544	Well, just do what I say and we'll get along fine.
697025	700735	On three, brush, wrap and fan, lift and scoop, scrape and scoop.
707330	708572	What's your name, son?
709012	709613	Wade, sir.
710234	711675	That's some buckle you got there.
712016	712576	Thank you, sir.
712937	717683	It means a lot coming from a man like you who, I can plainly see, knows a thing or two about buckles.
718083	721007	Well, uh, well, this round's on me.
721948	723029	Fangeric by left.
723249	723810	Hitch right.
724291	725612	Fan fan, double dog down.
725832	727414	Hitch kick now, select that heel.
727434	730418	Heel toe, heel toe, heel toe, knee toe heel.
730398	731760	Quarterback, huh?
731780	732321	Varsity.
732822	733483	Love your mama?
733743	734364	You know I do.
734865	736768	She cook with a gas range?
736808	737228	Propane.
739752	741515	I don't know if I'm ready, Uncle Hank.
741875	742556	Sure you are.
742977	744399	And Wade's a catch-and-a-half.
744800	746863	He can run the 40 in under five seconds.
747744	751289	But my heart is telling me that... Your heart is telling you who's the boss.
751370	752712	You or your heart.
752732	753252	You are.
753653	755836	Your heart is your employee.
755856	758380	So get your heart off its butt and back to work.
758765	760026	You're right, Uncle Hank.
760306	761307	What am I waiting for?
762208	763590	Let's go get weighed.
767473	769355	Bill, you need to have more confidence in yourself.
769856	772458	If you ask Peggy Hill, you boot scoot with the best of them.
772618	773920	Well, I don't know.
773940	777023	All right, this next one's going to be ladies' choice.
777643	781887	Excuse me, Bill.
781907	782808	Hey, Peggy.
782828	784009	Better than aerobics, huh?
784530	785931	You worked up quite a sweat.
786572	787793	That's not my sweat.
795265	796006	Where's Luan?
796427	797188	Luan's fine.
797228	799231	She's gonna get her eye at home with a friend.
799852	801334	Tush, push on three.
802195	802897	And three.
808305	810929	Is Luan gonna marry her new boyfriend?
810949	815576	Well, you never can tell, but my guess is, yeah.
815596	815856	Luan!
816680	817702	That's buckly.
818263	819405	Those better be for me.
819846	821288	No, they're for me for later.
821549	822590	Where's Luanne?
822811	824935	Luanne is out with her new boyfriend.
825415	826217	She's in love.
826277	827359	You blew it, Dip Head.
827619	829182	You can't compete with this new guy.
829222	833089	He's a football player, and football players know how to treat women right.
833470	835954	Now get off my lawn and don't come back.
837773	839195	Why'd you send Buckley away?
839636	840917	Luann wants him back.
841198	842099	Not gonna happen.
842119	843401	I found her a new guy.
843461	845303	You broke the rebound rule?
845744	847606	What has gotten into you, Hank?
847626	851031	Well, I was kind of hoping she might fall in love with Wade.
851271	854636	Well, hoping one hand and booing the other, see which one gets full first.
855477	856999	Mm-mm, you are out of your depth, Hank Hill.
857240	859022	You've opened a Pandora's box.
859002	862569	A box that has a sign that reads, For Women Only.
863250	871767	As long as it took that river to carve the Grand Canyon, that is how long women have been learning to subtly manipulate relationships.
871787	876015	You only think it's easy because we make it look easy.
875995	880803	Did you really believe you could step in and fix it overnight?
880823	883588	Could you really be such a fool?
883608	885751	Who is you, Hank Hill?
885771	886312	Who is you?
886412	887093	No, no!
887594	889357	No, everything's gonna be fine.
889978	891100	Wade's a good guy.
891360	891881	You don't know.
892001	893063	He runs fast.
893484	894385	It'll be fine.
895748	896569	What's that?
898979	899340	See?
899721	900603	Everything's fine.
901144	902467	Good ol' Wade drove her home.
903088	905954	Look at that, he's fixed his dodge up just like Boom Hours.
906415	908019	Well, why on earth would anyone do that?
909141	909863	Boom Hours?
912469	912749	Good night.
913270	914212	Thanks for the lift.
914834	915435	No!
929033	931216	Luanne, what happened to Wade?
931597	932858	Why aren't you with Wade?
933299	934340	I want Wade.
934601	937925	As soon as you left, Wade turned into Mr. Grabby Sam.
938586	941090	I think that you just fixed me up with him so you could get your den back.
941671	943193	Thank goodness, Boomhower gave me a lift.
943473	943874	A lift?
944274	945936	Is that what they're calling it these days?
946738	948019	You can't trust this guy.
948039	951364	He's a no-good, immoral, skirt-chasing rascal.
951765	954248	So, at least you like him better than Buckley.
954228	955290	What are you saying?
955310	956733	He's your new boyfriend?
956793	958376	Hank, so what if he is?
958636	960259	If he is, he ain't no more.
960480	961983	Hank, you can't tell me what to do.
962023	963125	You're not my father.
964207	965089	Yeah, I guess not.
965730	966812	Damn straight I'm not.
967192	969878	But while you're under my roof, I'm your landlord.
970138	973003	And as your landlord, I forbid you to date Boomhauer.
973084	973885	Shut up, Hank.
974086	975949	I can find another roof.
975929	977391	I'll stay at Boom Howers!
977752	978152	Fine!
978333	978793	Fine!
979334	981257	Wait, man, I'll just stay there and go work out, man.
981277	984262	Those little girls come around here, they just flat-out know, man.
984282	985103	Thanks, Boom Howers.
985123	985704	Let's go.
986505	988589	Dang old women from Mars, man.
988609	995599	I'll tell you what.
995620	997022	Don't go in there, Lou Ann.
997362	998023	I'm warning you.
998504	999305	You'll be sorry.
1000086	1003692	Damn it, this neighborhood is turning into Melrose Place.
1015687	1017772	Hank, it is after midnight.
1017812	1019055	What the heck are you doing?
1019496	1021641	Clearing some space from a leaf blower.
1022924	1023064	Mm-hmm.
1023084	1026011	Now, Hank, this is not about the leaf blower, is it?
1026171	1027013	Sure it is.
1031144	1033066	What are you eating?
1033366	1033706	Nothing.
1034007	1035708	You are eating your emotions, aren't you?
1035908	1036689	Maybe who knows?
1036809	1037190	I don't know.
1037250	1038211	I don't care, whatever.
1038471	1044356	You thought you could fix Lou Ann like a flywheel drive plate, but a flywheel drive plate doesn't talk back.
1044737	1047119	Flywheel drive plates do not have feelings.
1047139	1049221	Flywheel drive plates... I took her in, Peg.
1049341	1053465	I put a 20-year roof over her head and a sofa sleeper under the rest of her.
1053805	1055266	And this is the thanks I get?
1055547	1059210	Well, no thanks.
1059663	1060745	Just face it, Hank Hill.
1061005	1064850	The only reason you're this upset is because you care so much about Luanne.
1064910	1067414	The only thing I care about is getting my den back.
1072621	1074384	Boy, I've never been in here before.
1074404	1076406	Oh, it sure is bachelor-y.
1076446	1078830	Can I turn this light on?
1079651	1082575	Oh, uh, that's real pretty.
1082595	1084237	Uh, gosh.
1085379	1087662	Oh, you move very fast, boomhauer.
1088401	1098614	I'm having all these feelings and I need just a little time to... Okay, last case of beer.
1098654	1099677	Let's divvy it up.
1101023	1104127	Hey, it don't split up even anymore.
1104528	1105910	That one's Boom Howard's.
1106331	1108614	That cradle robber's getting none of my beer.
1108854	1110416	Boom Howard didn't do anything.
1110757	1112379	And even if he did, why do you care?
1112659	1114061	Lu Ann's not your relation.
1114222	1116465	Hell, she's my wife's brother's daughter.
1116906	1118388	You can't get any closer than that.
1119109	1121192	Look, let's just split that six pack up.
1121252	1122273	We can each take two.
1124056	1126940	Tell you what, why don't I just take the whole thing?
1127040	1127661	Okay, Mom.
1128021	1129984	Let's try and move a mile.
1130420	1136791	and split kick right and back and split kick left and sideways shuffle go!
1138074	1140758	Oh, are you okay, Bobby?
1141059	1141380	Yeah.
1141961	1144585	Well, it was a nice move.
1144605	1146649	Yeah.
1146669	1146869	Aw, honey.
1146889	1149414	It's just not right without Luan.
1149434	1150015	Yeah.
1154585	1156328	This was a nice idea, Pig.
1156668	1157810	Get us out of that house.
1158631	1162797	Son, they got eight kinds of ketchup here, and three kinds of ketchup.
1163619	1168646	Not that I'm going to have some of that fried chicken, fried plate, fried chicken, fried side, fried, fried okra.
1169708	1170409	Luan!
1170870	1172031	And boomhauer too.
1172312	1174014	Well, isn't this a nice surprise?
1174635	1177740	Uh, is that gravy lumpy tonight?
1178260	1179964	Hey, I'm Peggy, Uncle Hank.
1180184	1184273	I'll take a bowl of the white gravy and a bowl of brown gravy.
1184474	1188022	Hey, Dad, it's Luann, right behind you.
1188042	1189585	Dad, it's Luann.
1190387	1191850	Hey, Dad, can't you hear me?
1192171	1194075	Luann, right behind you.
1198105	1201410	Say, Hank, man, I don't know what you're thinking, man, but y'all got no man.
1201450	1204054	I ain't no dang old Woody Allen with that little soon lead, man.
1204074	1205236	This ain't nothing going to happen.
1205376	1208381	Boom, Hauer, you're not going to talk your way out of this one.
1208822	1209483	Uncle Hank?
1210564	1212327	Don't uncle me anymore, Lou Ann.
1212628	1215152	Just come on by tomorrow and pick your stuff up.
1215793	1217676	I got it all boxed and ready to go.
1221381	1222743	Well, you finally got your wish.
1222984	1224406	You are going to get your den back.
1224907	1225648	I hope you're happy.
1229543	1230805	Look at she's crying again.
1230825	1234829	I guess she just got dumped by her new boyfriend, Boomhauer.
1236131	1237252	Boomhauer didn't dump her.
1237272	1237693	You did.
1237933	1238234	What?
1238254	1238794	What was that?
1239015	1241257	She said Boomhauer didn't dump her.
1241317	1241898	You did.
1243120	1244061	Pass the kids up.
1252531	1253712	I came for my stuff.
1254033	1254994	That's all in there.
1257758	1277139	I was moving stuff around and it seems that the room looks a little better this way.
1279221	1280623	The bed is keeping out.
1280643	1284627	Well, I figure there's no sense in packing it up night after night.
1284995	1286777	Love you, Uncle Hank.
1288699	1291623	Oh, Lord.
1300032	1301073	See, still looking?
1304317	1304737	Yep.
1305358	1307941	You know, Hank, maybe it's time to settle this.
1308542	1312386	Yeah, I just hate these big emotional scenes.
1313513	1314875	Well, let's get it over with.
1316058	1316679	Boom hour!
1317340	1317660	Yep.
1318442	1318762	Beer?
1321207	1321487	Yep.
1323932	1329261	That was beautiful.
