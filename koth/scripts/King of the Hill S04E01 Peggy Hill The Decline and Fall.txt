Previously on King of the Hill.
Go!
You want to jump or not?
You've got my check.
What do you care?
I know where the Arlen Hospital is.
Can you hold it in?
Oh!
Peggy, it's amazing.
You've got to do it.
Uncle Hank did his half in the baby right now.
Wait.
Pull the cord!
Your emergency cord!
Hey!
Peggy?
Peggy!
I think my wife, I think, might be dead.
I'll be right back.
It's okay, son.
The baby's here.
He's beautiful.
What's his name?
Here you go to cut the umbilical cord.
My uncle.
Peggy!
Peggy!
Peggy!
Okay, think one piece.
Peggy!
Oh, God, you're all smashed up.
I'm alive.
Uncle Hank, we're too late.
Would you like to hold your baby now?
I'm not the father.
Yes, I would.
Okay, move it.
Good.
Keep her straight.
Laser, don't touch her.
Yes, thank you I wasn't watching just for a second.
I have no idea what the score is.
I couldn't tell you Your wife is gonna be just fine.
Yes Biggie has a compression fracture of the bones in her back.
Thank goodness for the mud
She would not have survived if she had fallen on concrete, Mr. Hill.
Or, uh, fence.
But she's okay.
Yes, they're putting her into a body cast right now to immobilize her while she heals.
Uh, what color is the cast?
What does that matter, Mr. Hill?
I don't know.
I've never been through this before.
I'm just trying to ask the right questions.
It's white, sponge bath, bedpan.
Thank you.
Peggy?
Hank, come on in.
Look at me.
I'm in an ensemble.
My top cast and my bottom cast match.
Yeah, quality plaster.
Well, I'm guessing that was Luanne.
Oh, I wish you wouldn't feel sorry for me when I feel so terrific for me.
I have had a near-death experience.
Most people never get that, except when it's right next to their death experience, and then they can't appreciate it.
You know what's odd?
The last thing I remember was deciding not to jump.
Hank, what or who would have made me change my mind?
Uh, oh, I'm not sure.
Uh, I don't know.
I wasn't in the plane.
I was on the ground, remember?
I'm the one who found you.
I fell 8,000 feet and survived!
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Bobby?
Dad!
Thank God!
I need a dollar bed.
Bobby?
You really fell out of a plane?
Yes, sir, I did.
Your mom is one of only 16 people who have survived parachutes not opening.
Now, 16 is my estimate.
I'll double-check my numbers later.
Um, I'm sorry about before.
I don't know what came over me.
Oh, God.
What would make you jump out of a plane?
That's exactly what I can't figure out.
Well, don't try too hard, because doctor says that could hurt your bones somehow.
So, Bobby, how was your day?
My day?
Don't get me started!
My day was incredible.
I was Dee Dee's birthing partner.
I cut the umbilical cord.
Dee Dee, where's Dee Dee?
Hank, what'd you do to your wife?
I didn't teach you that.
Where's my new dependent?
I'm supposed to look at it.
Where did I put?
Oh, there it is.
Uncle, I present you to your father.
Look at him.
His shins are perfect.
Could you look at me?
Look at you!
You're a handsome little soldier.
You wanna kill a nazi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
A nazi-nazis quasi?
What's the use?
I'm calling him Hank.
I always wanted a boy named Hank.
Uh, Dad Hank is my name.
Not anymore.
I'm taking it back.
He's Hank.
You can't take away a grown man's name.
Alright, I'll call him G.H.
Good Hank.
You see the way my boy looked at that nurse?
Practically slapped her rump, that in there.
Yeah, Uncle Goodhank is really something special.
Dad, this isn't right.
You call him Goodhank, it's gonna make it sound like I'm Badhank.
Well, you burnt my burger, didn't you, B.H.
?
Peggy, you've got to do it.
It's amazing.
It's the best dang feeling in the world.
Oh, no.
Don't tell her that.
Why did you tell her that?
Oh.
No, of course it's safe.
It's fail safe.
I guarantee you'll love it.
I command you to jump.
If you love me, you'll jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
Jump.
There we go.
Okay, now you try.
Let's see about all this.
Okay.
Put this over there, get it out.
Tap this little nibble in there.
Close up shaft.
There.
Ready for soiling.
What the?
The kid is leaking out of his chest.
That's from his nipples.
It's a form of lactation.
Dang it, you said it was a boy.
He is.
He's simply been ingesting a lot of female hormones from his mother.
It's so common it has a name, which is milk.
Oh, Lord, what did I do?
Was it the fitting man I killed?
Oh.
The maternity ward ceiling.
Oh, it reminds me of when my son was born.
And I am also reminded of when my next child will be born.
Why isn't the baby with his mother?
Didi Hill has postpartum depression.
She couldn't even gather up the strength to put on some lipstick.
And she looks awful.
Oh, that poor infant baby.
Is there something I can do?
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.
You just try not to get addicted to that morphine.
You did this to my son.
There's no milk coming out of these.
Cotton, stop it.
You should be comforting her.
Comfort her?
Comfort me!
Mr. Hill, your insurance company's automated voice says you have to leave the hospital today in 85 minutes.
But I can't take care of a drip in which child.
Can't we just stay hospitalin' until Dee Dee gets her brains back?
Well, maybe if you were the richest man in America.
More flowers, Mr. Hill?
Well, don't unwrap them.
Well, why not?
They told me downstairs they should be placed in water as soon as... You, your wife and those flowers are going home today.
Yeah, but Peggy's got a broken back.
I know.
I told you that.
But she wants to be discharged.
I'm not so worried about her back.
I'm worried about her emotional state.
Yeah, but she seems so happy.
Yeah, well, once the thrill of surviving wears off.
And it does, trust me.
Jetski, July 94.
She may experience a second crash when she feels her own limitations.
Well, there won't be any second crash.
As long as I'm around, I won't let her feel any limitations.
There's no need for you to feel this guilty.
You didn't make her jump.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, do you think you could put that on her chart?
Peggy, I'm here.
Hey, we're going home today.
I have packed myself up without any help from the nurses.
Are you sure you're ready?
Well, honey, ready or not, I have got to go.
I invited Cotton and Dee Dee and the baby to stay with me until they can take care of him on their own.
You think you can help them take care of a baby?
If that poor farm boy, whose arms were ripped off by a thresher, could dial 911 with his nose, then I think Peggy Hill can take care of that baby.
Maybe I signed it on the stomach.
No, the leg.
No, the stomach.
It's that natural.
Back off.
Back off, everybody.
Everybody.
That's our fault, Peggy, not your fault.
Try the back door, it'll fit.
Am I in a very wide bed?
Well, maybe we can get her in at an angle.
Come on, guys.
All right, on three.
She's left on three, man.
You don't mean to go one, two, down three and then go, or do you come lift right on three and then go?
Just lift now, okay?
Now.
Tilt towards me.
No, toward... Fine, away from me.
One, two, three.
Aye, baby.
Hello, Bill.
I think a thank you would be in order.
Peggy.
Dale, get the hell out of here.
Okay, enough.
I'm better off in the living room anyway.
I can run the whole house from here.
Hub of the wheel, hub of the wheel.
Uh, Luanne, I think you got two people sitting in the same chair there.
But that's Aunt Peggy's place.
I can't just put someone there like she doesn't exist.
She's still alive, I think.
Yeah, uh, you know, maybe it might do us all some good if you got away for a while.
How would you like a few nights at the Motel Arlen?
My treat.
How, way nine or six?
Nine.
No, thank you.
All right, six.
Yes!
Cast make you look good for Peggy Hill, like your mummy museum piece, but with attitude.
Mummy for the 90s.
Shug, you ain't helping.
You know, Peggy, people spend hundreds of dollars at a spa to get wrapped up like that.
Yes, it's very refreshing.
Well, I just can't believe your attitude.
Who would have thought?
Dee Dee's depressed and you're not.
Ah, the baby's here.
Oh, good.
The baby's here.
OK.
Men, make sure Dee Dee puts a hat on him.
And Nancy, you make sure he takes it off when he gets inside the house.
Bobby, honey, come on in here.
I will teach you how to change a diaper.
I already did it.
I fed him, washed him, diapered him.
GH is good to go.
But I got spit up on my good shorts.
Just put them by the sink.
I'll get right to it.
But maybe for now, just pull down your shirt.
Hello.
Someone.
Please!
Sorry, Peggy.
I was just washing your unmentionables here.
You know, towels, washcloths, that sort of thing.
Honey, I think a little piece of plaster fell in my underarm.
It is driving me crazy.
Left.
Might.
Left.
You know, I thought I'd be spending more time doing some hands-on baby care.
I guess that was just a little unrealistic, huh?
Well, you know Helen Keller was largely useless, but look how we remember her.
First lady of the American stage.
Oh, I feel so stupid for jumping.
It wasn't worth this.
I mean, why did I do it?
Do you remember?
This is really bugging me, Hank.
Uh, concentrate on where the straw is going, please.
Hank, the straw broke off five minutes ago.
Wait, wait, wait.
I just remembered something.
On the plane, I was talking to you on a phone.
Do planes have phones?
That's a good one.
I'll look into that.
No, I remember now.
I was talking to you.
But what did we say?
Well, you know, it sounds familiar, but with all the noise from the engines and then you falling and all, I'm not sure we'll ever know.
Please, Hank, you are going to have to be my memory because I don't have one anymore.
Deal.
No, I don't.
Yeah?
I'm hungry.
Hungry, but it's only... Okay, I'm on it.
G-H, I'm getting it.
I'm heating it up.
Oh, Bobby, good morning, honey.
How are you?
Dad, mom's talking.
How about some eggs?
You don't have to yell.
We can hear you just fine through the baby monitor.
Why am I being fed with a bottle, Hank?
Well, we're out of straws.
Well, I do not want to be fed with a bottle.
It's just easier, OK?
Please?
What is that?
Well, it should be Carnation Instant Breakfast.
Well, it tastes like formula.
Uh-oh.
You took Peggy's bottle and I took the baby's bottle.
Oh, now that's funny.
What are you doing?
Look, I do not want a bottle, okay?
I'm not hungry.
I want eggs.
Maybe Bob just needs to burp.
Bobby, could you give us a moment?
What's wrong?
My life is ruined.
I had to jump out of a plane for our anniversary.
I'm sorry, Hank.
I ruined both of our lives.
Okay, look.
It wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
What?
I do remember what I said to you in the plane.
I never didn't remember.
I begged you to jump, Peggy.
You didn't want to, but well, I made you.
Hank, wait.
Jump, Peggy.
Jump.
It's amazing.
It's the greatest dang feeling in the world.
Hank, I'm remembering.
I didn't jump because you told me to jump.
I jumped because of what you said right after that about how Dee Dee was starting to have her baby.
I jumped because I was jealous.
Well, you can still have a baby.
She's three years older than you and she just had a baby.
Do you know what torture that is?
I was once one of the finest mothers in the state of Texas, and now, now I can't even wipe a baby.
And I have to watch those two, cotton and stupid, with their beautiful new baby that they don't even want?
Well, what are you smiling about?
It wasn't my fault.
It's just such a load off my mind.
I feel lighter than air.
I mean, I feel bad in a new way, for you, because of what you were just saying, that stuff.
Just leave me alone, okay?
You just want me to leave?
Yes.
So, like, the right thing for me to do is just leave, even though you're crying.
Go!
Huh.
Well, I'm skeptical, but okay.
Up between the moon and New York City.
The best that you can do.
The best that you can do is fall in love.
Arthur, he does, is he, please?
Bobby, since you're doing all the woman's work around here, be a woman and get me my shin jelly.
GH kind of needs me right now.
So take him along.
Just get the jelly and ladder me up.
Fine, I'll get you the- Bobby, could you buy me some lottery tickets?
I am a twelve-year-old boy!
I am this child's nephew!
I cannot do this!
I cannot do this!
If anybody makes any dinner, I'll eat, but that's it!
All I'll do is eat!
Baby, stop crying.
I'm tired.
Dee Dee?
Didi, are you leaving?
No, please.
Someone has to watch the baby.
Because unless it's flying above my head, I cannot do it.
All right, help!
With somebody, hang!
What?
What's wrong?
I shouldn't have left, right?
You know, I had a feeling.
The baby.
Yeah?
It's crying.
It's always crying.
The baby hasn't stopped crying since it got here.
Just do something.
Hank!
Hank, Hank, wait, don't go!
Hank, don't go!
All right, I've had enough, Dad.
There's a baby crying in the house.
Well, go fix it.
You go fix it.
I ain't getting near that child.
He's possessed.
He's just leaking a little milk.
Sure it's disturbing, but he'll grow out of it.
How do you know?
Are you a leaker?
Are you leaking on me right now, Leaky?
What, you hear that?
That silence?
G8?
Something's wrong.
Isn't it amazing?
It's the greatest egg feeling in the world.
Anaisie, Anaisie, what is it?
