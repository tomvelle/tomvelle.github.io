Yeah.
Yeah, hey, man!
She's right right here!
She is power.
Enormous yellow power.
I feel like my whole life's been leading to this day.
So let's see how you guys did.
It's the biggest septic tank they had.
They sold one just like it to a bowling alley in Austin.
Guy tried to put us in a little home unit.
I told him, you don't know Bill.
Yeah, that's what he said.
It's a shame we have to put her in the ground.
I should have hit the old tank by now, Bill.
Are you sure you surveyed it precisely?
Uh, sure.
I mean, that's my recollection.
Oh, there that's where it is.
My mistake, sorry.
Maybe the tank's in the front, I don't know.
You just killed your whole back lawn.
A perfectly innocent lawn.
Okay, make shot.
Where's your tank?
Side lawn, eight feet out, nine feet seven inches from the pavement.
Side lawn.
Mine's on the side lawn too.
Bill, you can't just mark it where you think it might be.
That's not real marking.
The flag is in.
I am the ho-master.
Hear me ho!
Nailed, Mo!
Nailed!
It's what's up!
Put on the grill!
Oh!
Hank?
Hank, you were right about it being complicated, but wrong to make me want to try it so badly.
Where you going?
To buy the L-pipes for your septic tank.
Road trip!
You're staying here.
Didn't I come?
No.
I'll stay in the truck!
No, he's right.
I never would have stayed in the truck.
No, that's a straight pipe.
I'm looking for an L-pipe.
L's are straight.
Lowercase, maybe, but... Okay, fine.
I'm looking for a capital L-pipe.
It bends at a right angle.
Pipes don't bend.
All pipes are straight.
All pipes can't be straight.
If they were, your department store wouldn't be selling those U-pipes right behind your shoulder.
Those aren't pipes.
Now, wait a minute.
Your size drill bit.
There are different size holes.
How do you think that happens?
What the... Stupid... Nice truck.
Does the job?
Then some?
Did you get the recall notice about the belts?
Back in 94?
Yep.
Got it.
So, pick up some kind of L pipe?
Yep, two and a quarter inch.
Septic?
Yeah, it's my neighbors.
We rented a loader back home for the job.
I hear Mason's got a new design.
That's what I rented.
Well, then I won't keep you.
But then, my professor says to me that I have the greatest potential of any junior college student that he's ever seen.
And then he asked me to dinner to talk about it some more.
And drinks!
Dinner and drinks?
Luanne.
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
Well, what are you smiling about?
Well, I met a guy.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, at the Megalo Mart.
We have the same truck, same year, same color.
Smart guy, too.
He knew what an L-pipe was for.
It was nice.
Are you gonna see him again?
Oh, I don't know.
You know, just a one-time thing with a guy in a parking lot.
You know, that's all.
Hey, L-Pipe, how you doing?
You, uh, filling up with super?
Regular.
Just kidding.
Oh!
Hey, uh, you got some place you need to be or maybe you want to grab a beer?
Imported what no no domestic.
No imported I gotta watch you You know Peggy we're having the best time
No, we didn't talk about that.
No, he didn't mention it.
That didn't come up either.
Look, I'll be home later.
More.
More.
More.
Is it open?
Almost.
Try again.
What are you doing?
Get out of there.
Did you stop to think that maybe the backhoe wasn't the best tool for opening up a beer can?
Yeah, Hank, I did.
No, hang on.
Hank did it.
What would you guys think if someone had a beer with us out here?
Like someone just wanders over like a stranger?
No, no, this guy I know.
Good guy.
It's a big alley.
Well Hank sure does seem excited.
Hell, this is Dale, Bill and Boomhauer.
Hey fellas.
See, look, Hank told me about your situation, and I was thinking you could just use a metal detector to trace the pipes back to your tank.
A metal detector?
The detector would go off constantly due to the high levels of extraterrestrial alloy in our soil, which acts as a homing beacon to the Martian capital of Grrrr... City.
Yeah, that's a good joke, Dale.
Dale sure can tell a joke.
Ain't on the way over, I passed this huge track hoe.
Fourteen tonner, what do you say we go check her out?
Sorry, but we've got business to transact.
I'll go.
The hike's gonna come back... now.
Nope.
No.
Nope.
Mine is a dang old pathetic, man.
I don't know what I got a better thing to do than sitting around and talking about old Jenny Cam, man.
I don't know what they did to get in that shower.
I don't know.
Later.
I'm surprised Boob Howard stayed as long as he did.
Alright then.
Yep.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, so you care what we're doing, do you?
And you doesn't care.
You said you'd be back in a minute.
We waited a minute.
Then we waited another.
Then after about a million minutes, I forgot why I was counting.
Well, what's the big deal?
You don't get upset when I come home late from work.
One, we get very upset when you work late.
And two, you were out with him.
Didn't you think Peggy might be worried?
You've been gone so long.
I called her.
yeah well we're being phased out do not watch the eyes bobby the eyes cannot be trusted fool me once shame on you fool me
Hey, Peggy.
Hal just took me to this store that only sells fireplace hardware.
Fireplace hardware?
Boomhauer must have been in Hog Heaven.
Ah, yeah, well, I didn't really invite Boomhauer.
Or Bill, or Dale, for that matter.
Mom!
What?
Part of the fun with Hal is doing new stuff with someone new, and if the guys can't handle that, well, that's why I don't tell him.
Hank.
Hal?
So where's that bait and tackle shop you won't shut up about?
False alarm, Hank.
Went last night, they didn't know a floater from a sinker.
Now you want to see a great new store.
Make a left at the light, then out to McManerberry.
Sports shop that spins around.
Used to be a restaurant.
Hmm.
1015.
Hank picks up Hal.
What?
10-15.
Hank picks up Hal.
What?
I said 10-15.
Hank picks up Hal.
Hank and Hal, I see.
So this guy is trying to fill a service tank.
Uh-huh.
And the drip lip vent is in the six o'clock position.
But instead of twelve?
Exactly.
You sure you never worked in propane?
Hobby.
That's all.
I'm losing him.
Slowly.
You got to know when to hold him.
When to hold him?
I was a highway man.
Along the co-trodes I did ride.
With sword and pistol by my side.
Dang it, brother.
Hey, what's that?
There, there, over there.
Hey.
Dale?
Bill?
Dale?
Bill?
Well, I tell you, your tank's as big as a school bus.
They didn't pretty nicely, all the same.
All I see is trespassing.
Hank?
Hal?
That was our project.
You should be thanking me.
Hal worked that backhoe so fast, we're gonna save a couple days' rental.
Yeah, and with the money you save, you can buy your friend Hal a dozen roses.
Now you're buying him roses?
That's it, Hank.
It's us or him.
You can't make me choose.
Us or him.
All right, him.
Him means Hal, you know.
That's the way we phrase the question.
You know where I think we went wrong?
Making him choose.
Where we went wrong is not staying with that backhoe.
Whoever controls the backhoe controls Hank.
You think?
Yes, I do think.
As long as we're, for lack of a better word, incompetent with the backhoe.
We will be Hankless.
Well, I know a place we can practice.
The army's got an old minefield.
No one's ever there.
Don't be insane, Bill.
We'll never get past security.
But I know an abandoned pet cemetery with our names on it.
Nice hole, Bill.
Thank you.
May I?
Please?
Nickel says I can pick that dandelion over there, bring it back here, blow on it, and make a wish.
Come on.
Come on, honey pie.
Come on, baby.
Come on, please.
Come on, baby.
Bill, shift your weight, lean forward.
All right.
Maybe we could, uh, hold on to that tree branch and swing out the hole like a monkey in the jungle.
Help!
So what?
Help!
Well, forget it.
No one can hear us or if they can, they don't care.
You're lucky.
You're in the army.
You've got a tracking device in your teeth.
They'll find you.
I'll tell them where you are.
You're good people.
Hell, it's Hank.
Beer?
Sure.
Well, no, that won't work.
My wife will have dinner ready in an hour, and you're over 20 minutes away.
Yeah, next time.
So, Bobby, you know it's been a while since we've had a shoe shine party.
I'll get my box!
Hank, you don't really want to watch Bobby shine your shoes.
Honey, why don't you go out into the alley and have a beer with the guys?
Uh, alright.
What about Bobby?
It is spa-peggy and meatballs night.
You do not have to worry about Bobby.
Boom, Hauer?
I don't like.
Yep.
Yep.
Used to be a lot more lively around here.
Yep.
So, uh, got any big dates?
Man, don't leave me alone, man.
I'm talking about that old question, man.
Old question, question, question, man.
I don't like nothing about a dang old mother, man.
Old mother, when you gonna get married, don't make me grandmother.
No, no, they don't let me.
An exterminator in a pet cemetery.
I have many enemies here.
Took me about 17 minutes to get here.
Huh.
Took me 18.
Maybe tomorrow we can meet, uh, I don't know, uh, that Exxon over there.
That ought to even things out.
Uh, ma, I don't know.
I only get in 45 minutes lunch hour.
Let's try getting together tonight.
Eh, I don't know.
By the time I get home from Strickland, propane, and come down from the day... Let's shoot for next Saturday.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, no, Saturday's Bobby's football game, and he really likes me to watch it with him.
Huh.
Hmm.
Huh.
Guess this is it then.
Yeah.
Well, you take care of that truck of yours.
I'm gonna miss that crazy bastard.
We invested all that time and effort, maybe, in Hank, and he is forsaking us.
Everything forsakes me.
I mean, sometimes I think I should just stuck with myself out there.
We don't need Hank.
We are two beta males at the top of our game.
And you didn't mention that we're lovable and that I've got a lot of love to give.
I know.
Has Mark been treating you, sir?
I took a pretty big hit today.
I got worries.
Where's my backhoe, Hank?
Hey, how are you?
You want to come in and have a beer?
I want my backhoe.
It wasn't returned by Dale Gribble or Bill Dothriev?
No.
I saw them drive off on Joyride with Backhoe.
You mean they're missing?
Man!
Yeah, hey, man!
Two down!
Two to go!
There's gotta be something to eat in that box.
Looks like a fun project.
No!
It is none of your business.
We were just on our lunch break, which is over, so if you do not mind, we will be getting back to work.
Yeah, that's right.
That's good.
Did you see it move?
All right.
Well, I'll get out of your hair.
But before I go, I am curious.
What's the best way of driving out of that hole?
I mean, you guys have more experience with this machine than me.
What do you think?
Would it be better to widen the hole beyond the tree, then extend the boom, plant the bucket, let out the outriggers, then release and replant the bucket?
Wait, wait, will... Will humor your little experiment, but you'll have to slow down.
On your left there, pull the extender as far back as... Left, is it?
Yeah, the lever closest to me.
Take that in your hand.
Good.
Little more.
Little more.
Keep going.
Good.
My legs.
Well, you haven't moved in about 50 hours.
Thanks, but no thanks, Hal's friend.
Where is Hal?
Huh, Hank?
How's gone?
Yep.
Alright, let's go.
You think you can ignore me for two days and then act like nothing happened?
Alright, look.
You guys are something Hal will never be.
My neighbors.
Apology accepted.
Friendship is our country's sweetest wine.
Alright, you're very delirious.
So I was thinking on the backhoe rental, your friend Hal should chip in.
I mean, he used it too.
I can put you back in the ground.
Bye.
