WEBVTT

00:07.777 --> 00:09.119
Hey, look at that.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.831
Well, I guess we're finally getting some new neighbors.

00:23.118 --> 00:30.668
I tell you, if that boy handles the football half as good as he handles the cardboard box, Arlen High's got herself a new tight end.

00:31.589 --> 00:33.432
Hey, you think the dad's a good bowler?

00:33.892 --> 00:35.354
Yeah, he looks like a good bowler.

00:35.554 --> 00:37.497
Maybe he needs someone to bowl with.

00:38.067 --> 00:40.634
Notice how he lifts with his legs.

00:41.155 --> 00:43.321
I think they're gonna fit in just fine.

00:43.963 --> 00:44.625
Howdy fellas.

00:45.126 --> 00:46.350
What brings you to Ireland?

00:46.370 --> 00:49.478
Well, uh, this family hired us to move their stuff.

01:32.742 --> 01:33.803
Well, I'll be damned.

01:34.244 --> 01:35.745
They look Japanese.

01:35.886 --> 01:36.126
Nope.

01:36.586 --> 01:37.888
I think they're Chinese.

01:38.328 --> 01:39.089
How can you tell?

01:39.430 --> 01:44.255
Japanese guys usually have glasses and a suit and a tie and stuff like that.

01:44.696 --> 01:45.396
Uh-huh.

01:45.416 --> 01:47.078
Well, a neighbor's a neighbor.

01:47.539 --> 01:48.900
Let's go over and say hi.

01:49.381 --> 01:51.403
You reckon they even speak English?

01:51.704 --> 01:53.005
Yeah, man, them Chinese, man.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.687
You can't understand a word they say, man.

01:54.707 --> 01:57.450
They just try to listen to the whole upside down whatnot.

01:59.017 --> 02:00.880
Hi there, I'm Hank Hill.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.645
I live next door, which means I'm your neighbor and you're my friend.

02:05.607 --> 02:08.812
I think you'll find we have a great little community here.

02:09.413 --> 02:10.795
What do you think of it so far?

02:11.436 --> 02:13.278
I am Khan, Super Newsome Bone.

02:13.979 --> 02:17.485
Hmm, so that's pronounced... Khan, right?

02:18.146 --> 02:18.827
Nice to meet you.

02:21.951 --> 02:24.315
What the hell are you trying to do?

02:26.557 --> 02:28.900
So are you Chinese or Japanese?

02:29.381 --> 02:32.686
I lived in California last 20 years, but first come from Laos.

02:33.306 --> 02:33.967
Huh?

02:33.987 --> 02:34.468
Laos.

02:35.169 --> 02:35.790
We lay ocean.

02:36.050 --> 02:36.871
The ocean?

02:37.212 --> 02:37.973
What ocean?

02:38.113 --> 02:39.054
We all lay ocean!

02:39.315 --> 02:40.556
From Laos, stupid!

02:40.937 --> 02:42.880
It's a landlocked country in Southeast Asia.

02:43.180 --> 02:44.882
It's between Vietnam and Thailand, okay?

02:45.303 --> 02:47.025
Population, 4.7 million.

02:49.148 --> 02:52.513
So are you Chinese or Japanese?

02:53.675 --> 02:54.957
That is so very exciting.

02:55.458 --> 03:01.547
It's like we get to travel to the Orient without having to worry about diarrhea or being jailed for our pro-democracy beliefs.

03:01.587 --> 03:11.183
You know, at the beauty academy, they teach us that people aren't black or white or yellow or red, but their hair can be.

03:11.523 --> 03:13.727
I'm going to invite our new neighbors to dinner.

03:14.307 --> 03:16.611
We can't expect them to break the eyes.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.527
These people are by nature shy and reserved.

03:19.547 --> 03:25.061
I read somewhere that the Chinese language has 72 words for us, but no word for friend.

03:26.525 --> 03:28.069
Howdy, you all.

03:28.673 --> 03:29.534
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

03:30.155 --> 03:30.275
Yeah.

03:30.675 --> 03:31.657
Can you believe this crap?

03:32.217 --> 03:34.320
You want to live in this country, learn to speak English.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.321
I'm not going.

03:35.601 --> 03:36.623
But you promise.

03:36.983 --> 03:37.484
Why go?

03:37.524 --> 03:40.808
I could just stay home, order a bucket of chicken and watch Hee-Haw.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.649
Same thing.

03:41.909 --> 03:45.033
Khan, please, for once, try not to piss off neighbor.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.555
We kick out of Laos.

03:46.795 --> 03:48.217
We kick out of Anaheim.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.599
I'm tired of running.

03:53.263 --> 03:54.124
Hello, Khan.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.684
Oh, damn.

03:56.924 --> 03:57.364
Damn.

03:57.845 --> 04:00.068
Oh, you have damn fine house.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.070
Lead-free since 1988.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.614
This is my wife, Meen, and daughter, Con Junior.

04:06.035 --> 04:08.037
And this is Peggy Hill.

04:08.758 --> 04:13.003
On behalf of Arlen, Texas, I would like to welcome you to our country.

04:13.724 --> 04:16.687
Now, please make yourselves at home and take off your shoes.

04:17.228 --> 04:17.468
Wait.

04:17.969 --> 04:21.333
You just shampoo carpet?

04:21.353 --> 04:22.254
Come on, Bobby.

04:22.294 --> 04:23.215
Have some seconds.

04:23.255 --> 04:24.837
The girl's lapping you.

04:25.019 --> 04:27.082
I've never had beef chop suey before.

04:27.422 --> 04:27.863
Really?

04:28.424 --> 04:29.365
Oh, you poor dear.

04:30.306 --> 04:35.554
You know, I read somewhere that in certain parts of China, meat is as scarce as toilet paper.

04:35.894 --> 04:37.216
Well, where you read that?

04:37.617 --> 04:38.498
Oh, who can remember?

04:38.778 --> 04:42.383
You know, as a substitute teacher, I have to review all sorts of learning materials.

04:43.024 --> 04:44.246
My beat was on a placement.

04:44.566 --> 04:45.608
So you're a teacher?

04:46.709 --> 04:49.373
Maybe you can tell me why art and test scores are so low.

04:50.434 --> 04:51.155
I know why.

04:51.195 --> 04:54.520
It's because Khan Junior not there to bring up average.

04:54.989 --> 05:00.555
You know, my boy here might not be the best test taker, but he's got near perfect attendance.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.416
Tell him, Bobby.

05:02.798 --> 05:05.841
I hope you all save some room for my famous apple brown Betty.

05:05.881 --> 05:08.864
The recipe is a closely guarded family secret.

05:09.325 --> 05:12.188
Passed on from my mother's mother to my mother to me.

05:12.748 --> 05:14.891
And someday, I will give it to my Bobby.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.735
Well, at least the brown Betty was good.

05:18.867 --> 05:20.229
You must give me recipe.

05:20.810 --> 05:22.813
Oh, man, you know I can't do that.

05:23.313 --> 05:25.536
But what I can do is offer you some leftovers.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.960
Here, now just reheat this for 10 minutes.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.584
I have already said way too much.

05:31.305 --> 05:33.307
Well, y'all come back now, you hear?

05:33.348 --> 05:35.771
That's Texan for Sayonara.

05:36.632 --> 05:38.174
Oh my, Peggy here.

05:38.495 --> 05:41.659
What big feet you have, like boat.

05:41.679 --> 05:43.542
Well, that's just the way God made me.

05:47.268 --> 05:48.973
Hey, look at me!

05:48.993 --> 05:50.879
I'm like little girl in mama's shoes!

05:52.123 --> 05:55.253
Okay, bye-bye now, bye-bye!

05:55.313 --> 05:57.700
Now, honey, she didn't mean anything, bud.

05:57.781 --> 06:01.206
You do not come into a woman's home and insult her fate.

06:01.246 --> 06:02.247
You just don't.

06:02.268 --> 06:03.369
Oh, come on, Peg.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.153
Remember when you first moved here from Montana?

06:07.095 --> 06:09.658
He called Pops so depop.

06:09.678 --> 06:12.422
And you thought 93 in the shade was hot.

06:12.963 --> 06:14.766
Our new neighbors are just like you.

06:14.806 --> 06:19.052
All they need is a little bit of time and Hank Hill to watch out for them.

06:19.472 --> 06:21.555
Well, do you think my feet are too big?

06:22.337 --> 06:24.700
No, there's just more of you to love.

06:25.810 --> 06:26.732
Ow.

06:27.073 --> 06:27.414
Sorry.

06:35.953 --> 06:36.795
Be careful, Bobby.

06:36.835 --> 06:39.381
That's one of them Chinese fighting dogs.

06:39.395 --> 06:41.158
Oh, it's a West Highland Terrier.

06:41.418 --> 06:42.660
Yeah, that's it.

06:42.681 --> 06:43.582
So what's his name?

06:44.103 --> 06:44.443
Doggy.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.707
Yes, Con Junior, he's a doggy.

06:46.727 --> 06:48.170
Now, can you tell me his name?

06:48.470 --> 06:49.292
He's called Doggy.

06:49.833 --> 06:53.278
And that's called a doggy too, but her name is Lady Bird.

06:53.759 --> 06:56.063
She's a purebred Georgia bloodhound.

06:56.564 --> 06:58.507
Her momma tracked down James Earl Wraith.

07:00.290 --> 07:00.651
Yeah!

07:00.671 --> 07:01.993
Uh, aren't kids great?

07:02.513 --> 07:06.041
They're too young to know about fear or prejudice.

07:06.061 --> 07:08.407
They won't have to learn that till high school.

07:09.088 --> 07:12.276
Yep, there's a real lesson here for all of us.

07:12.296 --> 07:12.978
Move, please.

07:13.178 --> 07:14.481
You're standing on my hose.

07:19.642 --> 07:23.767
Dad, look, Lady Bird and Doggy like each other.

07:23.787 --> 07:24.908
Of course they do, son.

07:24.948 --> 07:25.589
They're neighbors.

07:26.290 --> 07:29.534
You know, Con, I just found a breeding partner for my Lady Bird.

07:29.934 --> 07:34.259
If you're interested in having a real American dog, I can give... What the hell?

07:34.419 --> 07:35.220
Get him off!

07:35.240 --> 07:36.662
Get him off of her!

07:36.842 --> 07:38.704
Your Lady Bird!

07:38.724 --> 07:39.765
She's real slut!

07:39.785 --> 07:41.728
Lady Bird is not a slut.

07:42.288 --> 07:43.009
She is in heat.

07:43.530 --> 07:47.134
Her hormones have overwhelmed her natural modesty.

07:48.312 --> 07:51.198
For Pete's sake, would you tie up your dog?

07:51.498 --> 07:52.380
You tie your dog?

07:52.661 --> 07:53.642
She seduced my doggy.

07:53.903 --> 07:54.705
That's ridiculous.

07:54.765 --> 07:58.452
Lady Bird can only love another purebred Georgia bloodhound.

07:58.893 --> 08:00.456
You know what I think, Hank Hill?

08:00.857 --> 08:02.480
I think you a narrow-minded redneck.

08:02.740 --> 08:03.321
Oh, I get it.

08:03.642 --> 08:06.548
Just because I'm from Texas, I gotta be some kind of redneck.

08:06.949 --> 08:09.514
Chinese and their stupid stereotypes.

08:09.534 --> 08:10.776
Get out my property!

08:14.317 --> 08:15.319
Sorry, Lady Bird.

08:15.760 --> 08:23.974
I know you didn't mean to, uh, have relations with that dog, but I gotta tie you up anyway, if only to protect your virtue and good name.

08:34.493 --> 08:36.156
Well, hey, look there.

08:36.372 --> 08:39.617
Maybe Con will let you borrow his sexy little import.

08:39.637 --> 08:44.305
I'd cut my entire quarter acre with the lady bick before I'd borrow that man's mower.

08:44.886 --> 08:45.867
I just don't like him.

08:46.248 --> 08:46.549
Why?

08:46.869 --> 08:48.091
Because he's Chinese?

08:48.331 --> 08:48.612
No.

08:49.013 --> 08:49.854
It's always great.

08:49.894 --> 08:51.917
What the hell's the difference?

08:51.937 --> 08:53.179
I don't like the man.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.443
That has nothing to do with where he's from.

08:55.543 --> 08:56.925
I'm no redneck.

08:56.945 --> 08:59.089
He could be from Mars for all I care.

08:59.369 --> 09:02.835
Believe me, Hank, if Con were from Mars, you'd care.

09:02.815 --> 09:08.906
Especially after he's stolen every last drop of earth's drinkable water to transport back to his home planet.

09:10.729 --> 09:11.250
Mars.

09:12.713 --> 09:13.955
Come up, stop dawdling the wind.

09:14.135 --> 09:17.341
We've got to pick up that pizza before the cheese gets cold and the pineapple gets hot.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.664
What's the rush?

09:19.164 --> 09:21.128
If we're not there in 30 minutes, it's free.

09:24.010 --> 09:24.591
Peggy here!

09:24.831 --> 09:26.113
Peggy here!

09:26.133 --> 09:27.215
Wait, Peggy, it's me.

09:29.098 --> 09:29.198
Stop.

09:29.218 --> 09:30.460
Oh, my man.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.383
I almost did not see you there.

09:32.423 --> 09:33.985
Peggy here.

09:34.005 --> 09:36.930
I feel deeply, deeply sorry about dinner.

09:37.391 --> 09:38.713
We get off to bad start.

09:39.113 --> 09:40.956
I see things I should only have thought.

09:41.594 --> 09:42.255
Oh, Min.

09:43.036 --> 09:43.557
Thank you.

09:44.519 --> 09:47.063
I mean, it must have taken a lot of courage to apologize like that.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.105
And I know.

09:48.466 --> 09:50.229
I was once the new girl in town myself.

09:50.589 --> 09:50.910
Me?

09:51.150 --> 09:51.611
Khan?

09:51.811 --> 09:53.955
Khan Junior have a barbecue tomorrow.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.778
It means so much if you come.

09:55.958 --> 09:57.120
Well, thank you, Min.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.483
We would be honored to come.

09:58.863 --> 10:04.513
And if you need any help with the barbecue, or if you just want to know what a barbecue is, you give me a call.

10:07.379 --> 10:08.300
Uh-uh, Peggy.

10:08.561 --> 10:09.241
I can't go.

10:09.382 --> 10:09.762
I won't.

10:10.403 --> 10:12.426
Not after what he said about Lady Bird.

10:12.766 --> 10:14.008
Oh, Hank, come on.

10:14.408 --> 10:15.790
Now, Min and I just made up.

10:16.131 --> 10:16.912
We have to go.

10:17.292 --> 10:21.357
And if you stay home, people will think you don't like Conn just because he's Oriental.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.619
That is ridiculous.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.483
I hate the man because he's rude and nasty.

10:25.963 --> 10:29.148
Not because of what his people did to us in WW2.

10:29.168 --> 10:30.429
Well, Hank, I know that.

10:30.770 --> 10:33.994
But everyone else, they'll say Hank Hill is a racist.

10:33.974 --> 10:38.362
What the hell kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?

10:38.482 --> 10:44.072
Hank Hill, you will go to that party, you will pretend to like con, and you will drink until you actually do.

10:48.260 --> 10:48.861
Go on.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.708
Uh, howdy, Conn.

10:52.728 --> 10:53.850
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

10:54.211 --> 10:54.772
Here you go.

10:55.594 --> 11:00.464
I thought you might enjoy 7.5 gallons of pure premium propane.

11:00.845 --> 11:01.366
Are you kidding?

11:01.987 --> 11:03.250
No, I cook with mesquite.

11:03.892 --> 11:05.635
Give meat a nice taste of wood.

11:05.655 --> 11:06.998
And I cook with propane.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.123
Gives meat a nice taste of meat.

11:09.323 --> 11:10.225
Thank you.

11:10.289 --> 11:11.070
Hey, whatever.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.933
Some cultures like mesquite, some prefer propane.

11:14.353 --> 11:15.755
Doesn't mean we can't all get along.

11:16.255 --> 11:21.321
Just because I happen to sell propane and propane accessories... Okay, all right.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.562
Go stick tank on the table.

11:23.003 --> 11:24.324
Keep napkins from blowing away.

11:24.524 --> 11:25.926
Con, super news upon.

11:26.667 --> 11:27.528
Ah, okay.

11:28.168 --> 11:31.472
You honor me by giving me gas.

11:31.532 --> 11:32.453
Doggy's just like me.

11:32.973 --> 11:35.436
He's new in town and he's only got one friend.

11:36.327 --> 11:38.010
But at least you're not tied up.

11:38.451 --> 11:41.777
If I were, I'd just dislocate my shoulders and slip out of the knot.

11:42.277 --> 11:43.459
I'd chew through the leash.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.124
I bet it tastes just like a Bible cover.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.009
Hey, let's untie them.

11:49.350 --> 11:50.392
They belong together.

11:50.432 --> 11:52.776
And it's fun to watch them play piggyback.

11:53.537 --> 11:54.599
There you go, boy.

11:54.619 --> 11:56.242
Go play with Lady Bird.

11:56.602 --> 11:58.065
Be with your true love.

12:03.378 --> 12:04.303
Wait!

12:04.323 --> 12:05.247
Come back!

12:05.267 --> 12:12.021
You're in love!

12:13.486 --> 12:15.970
Oh look, it's Piggy here, my new best friend!

12:17.632 --> 12:20.196
She's so pretty in her little yellow sundress.

12:20.617 --> 12:22.780
Oh man, you are so sweet.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.165
I could just mix you up in some jello and eat you for dessert.

12:26.826 --> 12:28.729
Oh Piggy here, look at husbands.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.233
Too bad men don't get along like we do.

12:31.493 --> 12:32.475
We get along?

12:32.955 --> 12:34.077
Man, stupid.

12:34.057 --> 12:38.685
Women's smart mm-hmm the whole world over hey Peggy here.

12:38.945 --> 12:41.329
Look what I make Peggy here brown Betty.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.413
Oh, but that's impossible.

12:43.473 --> 12:48.040
I never gave you the oh Where'd you get my granny's recipe?

12:48.060 --> 12:54.631
I figured out myself and then make it better her recipe missing one thing Flavor I thank your Pete.

12:54.651 --> 12:57.496
I add flavor not make flavor now tastes much better.

12:57.516 --> 12:58.798
Don't you think Peggy here?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.025
Please try a Piggy Brown Betty.

13:01.286 --> 13:03.369
Would you like a Piggy Brown Betty?

13:03.389 --> 13:03.609
It's tasty.

13:03.629 --> 13:04.150
Delicious.

13:04.591 --> 13:09.458
While Piggy, to be honest, I have always had trouble keeping your brown Betty down, but this here is pure heaven.

13:12.683 --> 13:14.426
Those burgers look pretty done to me.

13:14.486 --> 13:15.307
Not yet.

13:16.269 --> 13:17.691
You might want to turn them now.

13:17.971 --> 13:18.592
Too soon.

13:19.073 --> 13:19.514
Okay.

13:22.518 --> 13:25.663
Uh... Whoa.

13:27.955 --> 13:29.517
You might want to turn them now.

13:29.577 --> 13:30.378
No.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.178
Please go away.

13:31.339 --> 13:32.820
Please, Con, you're burning them.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.222
That's too much char.

13:34.322 --> 13:40.568
Shut mouth and open mouth.

13:40.588 --> 13:40.648
Oh.

13:40.668 --> 13:40.748
Hmm.

13:40.768 --> 13:41.729
Boy, howdy.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.993
That is the best damn burger I ever ate.

13:47.115 --> 13:48.557
Stop, stop pushing.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.678
That's enough for everyone.

13:50.158 --> 13:53.061
If three of you go home right now, ha ha ha.

13:53.722 --> 13:54.423
Joke.

13:54.483 --> 13:56.105
Doggy.

13:56.165 --> 13:56.545
Doggy.

13:57.098 --> 13:58.039
Con Junior?

13:58.099 --> 13:58.981
Yeah?

13:59.602 --> 14:01.284
Why are you named Con Junior?

14:01.765 --> 14:02.926
My father wanted a boy.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.529
Yeah, so did mine.

14:04.949 --> 14:06.011
My dad is so lame.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.675
He makes me practice violin five hours a day.

14:08.995 --> 14:12.060
My dad won't let me watch TV more than five hours a day.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.206
Well, my dad's making me memorize 2,000 words for the SAT.

14:16.706 --> 14:17.948
He's such an autocrat.

14:19.170 --> 14:21.233
What's a SAT?

14:22.141 --> 14:25.966
I tell you, Peggy, there's nothing these people can't make better.

14:26.706 --> 14:30.651
First the automobile, then the color TV, and now the hamburger.

14:31.192 --> 14:32.093
How do they do it?

14:32.313 --> 14:34.356
With a dash of nutmeg, Hank.

14:34.376 --> 14:35.497
A dash of nutmeg.

14:35.877 --> 14:36.678
Oh, Peggy here!

14:36.979 --> 14:40.002
Your husband likes burgers so much, I give you a recipe.

14:40.303 --> 14:41.504
Now you can please him.

14:43.426 --> 14:48.212
I don't care what country he's from, any man who can make a burger like that is okay by me.

14:49.073 --> 14:50.595
Oh, you said it.

14:51.301 --> 14:56.228
Boy, it was so good, it's almost a shame to lose it to the process of digestion.

14:56.409 --> 14:59.113
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, the dang old onion soup powder, man.

14:59.133 --> 15:02.097
Just put that little bit old ab you don't need old grilled onions, man.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.259
How about you, Dale?

15:03.299 --> 15:04.621
How many you got under your belt?

15:04.982 --> 15:05.503
Zero.

15:06.043 --> 15:06.164
Huh?

15:06.584 --> 15:07.005
How come?

15:08.367 --> 15:09.629
Don't eat dog.

15:16.099 --> 15:16.720
Okay.

15:17.260 --> 15:20.245
Here are the facts as I see them.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.618
Khan served your dog.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.901
Khan did not serve us dog.

15:24.301 --> 15:26.264
That's just an awful stereotype.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.426
Chinese people don't really do that.

15:28.686 --> 15:29.227
Well, I don't know.

15:29.707 --> 15:32.651
Anyone crazy enough to put nutmeg in brown Betty?

15:32.991 --> 15:34.713
Well, they'd be crazy enough to do anything.

15:35.514 --> 15:38.938
Hey, even if they did feed us dog, you know, who are we?

15:39.258 --> 15:41.140
Who are we to judge other cultures?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.722
You know, maybe they're on to something.

15:44.407 --> 15:46.009
They did invent paper, you know.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.330
Quit talking like that.

15:47.831 --> 15:49.512
Dog is man's best friend.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.474
You wouldn't eat your best friend, would you?

15:51.494 --> 15:52.555
Of course not.

15:52.575 --> 15:55.138
Wait, are we talking about some kind of lifeboat situation here?

15:55.158 --> 15:57.080
Because I don't want to paint myself into a corner.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.962
Look, I can settle this right now.

15:59.222 --> 16:00.684
That woman gave us a recipe.

16:01.605 --> 16:01.845
See?

16:02.085 --> 16:02.526
Right here.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.008
It says chopped meat, not chopped dog.

16:05.349 --> 16:06.430
Dog is meat.

16:07.831 --> 16:07.891
Mm.

16:07.911 --> 16:08.812
You said it, friend.

16:10.754 --> 16:11.755
Oh.

16:11.976 --> 16:14.278
I was just trying to get that awful taste off my fingers.

16:28.805 --> 16:29.225
Doggy?

16:30.327 --> 16:31.068
Doggy?

16:31.088 --> 16:31.588
Hello?

16:32.009 --> 16:32.690
Dog pound?

16:32.890 --> 16:33.691
Yes, hello?

16:34.612 --> 16:36.394
I'm looking for dog.

16:36.414 --> 16:37.936
Sweet, sweet dog.

16:38.356 --> 16:40.839
Have big barbecue today and dog run out.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.302
All about 20, 25 pound.

16:43.662 --> 16:45.024
Good lord, it's true.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.347
Oh, I'll call you back.

16:47.387 --> 16:48.348
Hey, Kill.

16:48.368 --> 16:49.569
What a nice surprise.

16:49.950 --> 16:51.111
Hey, Khan, come quick.

16:51.251 --> 16:52.613
Your best friend is here.

16:53.053 --> 16:53.454
Oh, no.

16:53.994 --> 16:54.996
Uh, that's OK.

16:55.396 --> 16:57.158
What are you doing here?

16:59.230 --> 17:01.834
I can't hear you over my weed, Parker.

17:02.395 --> 17:03.997
Hey, where you going, kiddo?

17:04.017 --> 17:04.578
Stop!

17:04.919 --> 17:05.680
I can't hear you.

17:06.180 --> 17:07.082
My good tentamom!

17:07.843 --> 17:08.945
What you doing?

17:09.325 --> 17:10.667
You ruined my yard!

17:10.747 --> 17:12.129
You crazy redneck!

17:12.149 --> 17:13.011
That's a niff!

17:15.334 --> 17:17.057
We're never gonna find Doggie.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.219
I know.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.021
Wanna ride bikes?

17:21.203 --> 17:24.187
Hey, Lady Bird's a bloodhound.

17:24.448 --> 17:25.850
Maybe she can find Doggie.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.212
Yeah!

17:27.597 --> 17:28.989
Come on, Lady Bird.

17:29.110 --> 17:32.258
Lead us to Doggie.

17:46.025 --> 17:47.527
My God, Dale, you were right.

17:47.727 --> 17:48.789
Their dog is gone.

17:49.290 --> 17:49.871
All gone.

17:50.071 --> 17:53.195
I caught men on the phone with some kind of doggy butcher.

17:53.476 --> 17:55.298
She was placing an order.

17:55.318 --> 17:56.700
This is very dangerous.

17:57.061 --> 17:58.142
They know that you know.

17:58.383 --> 17:59.885
And now they gotta come after you.

18:00.165 --> 18:00.626
They do?

18:00.846 --> 18:01.067
Yep.

18:01.507 --> 18:03.170
They'll probably get you with a blow dart.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.051
That's their way.

18:04.311 --> 18:06.154
But you'll just think it's a mosquito bite.

18:06.394 --> 18:08.958
Until you die, then you'll know the truth.

18:08.978 --> 18:09.358
Why?

18:09.459 --> 18:10.640
Why would they shoot people?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.543
Human meat's tough, flavorless.

18:12.563 --> 18:15.407
They should be out hunting for more dog.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.704
Good God!

18:19.945 --> 18:25.393
He's got Lady Bird!

18:25.413 --> 18:26.354
It's still wet.

18:26.715 --> 18:27.716
Maybe there's time.

18:28.297 --> 18:30.340
Come on guys, we gotta save Lady Bird.

18:34.165 --> 18:34.906
Gah!

18:34.927 --> 18:35.628
I've been hit!

18:36.148 --> 18:36.769
Quick!

18:36.789 --> 18:38.712
Somebody suck out the poison!

18:55.583 --> 18:56.457
Oh no!

18:56.599 --> 18:57.696
Lady Bird!

18:59.650 --> 19:01.071
Whoa.

19:01.091 --> 19:02.753
That psycho Redneck is back.

19:03.193 --> 19:04.214
Why, he's so mad.

19:04.955 --> 19:05.756
You do something wrong?

19:06.136 --> 19:07.898
You're the one who insulted his propane.

19:08.258 --> 19:10.861
You're the one who made fun of Peggy Hill's monster feet.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.722
Open up, Con.

19:12.742 --> 19:13.583
Open up now.

19:13.943 --> 19:14.584
Get my bat.

19:15.044 --> 19:15.965
I know you're in there.

19:16.025 --> 19:17.186
Go away.

19:17.207 --> 19:18.548
I do nothing wrong.

19:18.748 --> 19:26.675
Look, Con, I understand that life is valued differently in your part of the world, largely as a result of overcrowding and famine.

19:27.396 --> 19:29.438
But you're in my country now.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.559
You're a crazy man.

19:30.839 --> 19:31.760
I call the police.

19:31.780 --> 19:34.422
If anyone's going to be calling the police, it's going to be me.

19:34.863 --> 19:35.323
Police?

19:35.784 --> 19:36.744
What do you want from me?

19:37.525 --> 19:38.946
I want my lady bird.

19:39.247 --> 19:40.167
You understand me?

19:40.508 --> 19:42.269
Give me my dog back or else.

19:43.390 --> 19:43.911
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

19:44.291 --> 19:44.911
Tough guy.

19:45.372 --> 19:46.173
I'm so scared.

19:46.473 --> 19:47.694
You want a piece of this?

19:47.714 --> 19:48.595
Dad, no!

19:48.775 --> 19:49.676
It's all our fault.

19:49.776 --> 19:50.917
We lost the dogs.

19:51.217 --> 19:55.621
They wanted to play with each other, so we untied them, and they ran away, and now we can't find them.

19:55.881 --> 19:56.522
You what?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.243
You mean you...

19:58.578 --> 20:01.081
The, the dogs, they're still alive?

20:01.501 --> 20:02.683
What do you think happened?

20:02.703 --> 20:04.885
Well, I, uh, nothing.

20:05.186 --> 20:06.347
We're sorry, Dad.

20:06.447 --> 20:07.749
We looked everywhere.

20:08.029 --> 20:09.030
We really did.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.693
Bobby, you really screwed up this time.

20:11.854 --> 20:14.417
Con, Junior, you fought in with a bad crowd.

20:14.477 --> 20:16.259
You made me fight with my neighbor.

20:16.319 --> 20:18.081
You made the neighbor man crazy.

20:18.121 --> 20:19.142
Go to your room!

20:21.245 --> 20:23.387
What, you say, go to your room?

20:23.603 --> 20:25.827
I say, go to your room.

20:26.508 --> 20:27.009
You spank?

20:27.370 --> 20:27.931
No, sir.

20:28.351 --> 20:29.253
Don't believe in it.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.596
No, me neither.

20:30.616 --> 20:31.597
I think it barbaric.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.901
How about bed without dessert?

20:34.262 --> 20:36.065
Never fail.

20:36.085 --> 20:36.165
Huh.

20:36.186 --> 20:40.894
Wouldn't figure a child could be motivated by a fortune cookie and an orange slice.

20:41.375 --> 20:45.983
Oh, the cookie may be small, but it contains great wisdom.

20:46.486 --> 20:48.208
And orange is sweet and juicy.

20:48.228 --> 20:55.037
You know, Con, we may deny our kids completely different desserts, but they both go to bed hungry.

20:55.618 --> 20:57.941
And that's what really matters.

20:57.961 --> 21:01.666
Well, I guess we're not so different after all.

21:02.688 --> 21:03.529
Boy, howdy.

21:03.549 --> 21:03.689
Woo!

21:04.050 --> 21:06.132
Woo!

21:06.152 --> 21:06.233
Woo!
