1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:18,489
Why do you say we tee off together, Hank?

2
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:22,455
Sure thing, Willie.

3
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:29,546
Dead solid perfect!

4
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,527
Ha ha!

5
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,682
You know, Hank, I've always wanted to sell propane and propane accessories like you do.

6
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,129
I guess this dang music thing came up.

7
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,078
Well, there ain't no change in the past, I guess.

8
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,921
Let's jam.

9
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:09,846
What in the name of dad?

10
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:12,914
Bobby!

11
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:14,318
Uh-oh.

12
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,651
Son, have you lost your mind?

13
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,493
Aren't you supposed to knock first?

14
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:49,715
I could have been naked.

15
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,798
Bobby, how many times have I told you?

16
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,041
Betsy is not a toy.

17
00:01:54,401 --> 00:02:00,750
She's a 1963 Guild Solid Top... What's that smell?

18
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,873
You been playing this with your feet?

19
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,555
That's cheese, Dad.

20
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:08,776
Why would there ever be cheese on Betsy?

21
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,039
It's funny.

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,442
It's a comedy routine.

23
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:15,673
You know, you play the guitar with a piece of cheese and you go, hey, look at me.

24
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,658
I'm Eddie Cheddar.

25
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:21,126
You know it's from Celeryhead.

26
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,211
What is a celery head?

27
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,334
He's the world's best comedian.

28
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,415
He glues things.

29
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:33,946
Like he glues a clean Xbox to a tennis shoe and goes, this is in case you have a runny nose.

30
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,448
That's not a joke, son.

31
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,331
That's a waste of good glue.

32
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,415
Well, he makes $3 million a year.

33
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:42,077
You must have got that wrong.

34
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:45,262
People don't pay money to see things like that.

35
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,987
Now, Robert Klein, that's something you pay money for.

36
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:51,339
What is going on in there?

37
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,562
Thank you, I'm worried about our boy.

38
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:57,748
Some green-haired freak told him to rub cheese on my guitar.

39
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,851
Oh, you mean celery head.

40
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,994
I saw him on entertainment tonight.

41
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,518
He makes three million dollars a year.

42
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,666
Luan, good lord, put on some pants.

43
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:10,948
I'm wearing shorts.

44
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,012
Don't scare me like that.

45
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,729
Look at this, Peggy, the boy chipped Betsy's bridge.

46
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,633
And he woke me up from my Willie Nelson golfing dream number three.

47
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,756
I, calm down, it is just a bunch of wood and some wires.

48
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:26,877
Wood and wires?

49
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,540
I've had Betsy since high school.

50
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,081
I took her to the prom.

51
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,123
I love this guitar.

52
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:34,925
Do you understand what I'm saying?

53
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:37,288
Do you understand what love means?

54
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,270
Yes, I love my family.

55
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,491
Yeah, now you're getting it.

56
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,594
That's the kind of love I have for Betsy.

57
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,132
I'm going back to sleep, you coming?

58
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:47,333
I'm already up.

59
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,476
Besides, I wouldn't want to make Betsy jealous.

60
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:54,020
Luanne, would you please not sit like that?

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,946
I sell propane and propane accessories, I tell you what.

62
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,587
Shut up, Dale!

63
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:09,033
Oh, Willie, no!

64
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:10,695
That's a one-way street!

65
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,593
Right, Bobby.

66
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:15,133
What happened to my truck?

67
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:15,514
Your mower hit it.

68
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:19,538
Well, maybe I ought to send my mower to one of those children psychologists.

69
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:23,943
Are you mad about something, Aunt Peggy?

70
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:24,763
Mad.

71
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,065
Why would I be mad?

72
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:29,609
Just because Hank pays more attention to that silly guitar than he does to me.

73
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:33,993
Lay off the gas, Aunt Peggy.

74
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:36,476
If I break another nail, I'll fail my manicure final.

75
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,598
Are you having trouble at the beauty academy, Louie?

76
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:39,619
No.

77
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,153
I'm also failing braid work.

78
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:45,936
Braid work does not come natural to the women in our family, honey.

79
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,861
You know it, I know it, and the whole town knows it.

80
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,884
Sounds like your whore's going off.

81
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,026
You really think so, Bill?

82
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:55,448
Oh, yeah.

83
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:57,070
Damn it, Hank.

84
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,895
You know I can't have loud, sudden noises while I'm meditating.

85
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,499
I was a nose hair away from attaining inner peace.

86
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,285
Don't even try to take credit for that.

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,282
It was not done by me.

88
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,466
It was done through me.

89
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,311
What is that chinging noise?

90
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:22,799
One of those stealth helicopters with computerized noise cancellation capability.

91
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:26,064
They're still working the chings out.

92
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,788
How'd you know about stealth helicopters?

93
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:32,033
Alt dot conspiracy dot black dot helicopters.

94
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,398
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, that dang old internet, man.

95
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:40,261
You just go on there and point and click, get in there and talk about www.duby.com and you got that naked chicks on there, man.

96
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,008
You just go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

97
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,153
It's real easy, man.

98
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,897
Bobby, give me that club!

99
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,762
Son, maybe I'm not getting through to you.

100
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,004
Let me explain.

101
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,010
You gotta respect other people's things.

102
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:59,397
You do not use a man's pitching wedge to hit clumps of mud.

103
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,060
It's not mud, dad.

104
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,342
It's dog dew.

105
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,347
Boy ain't right.

106
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,230
Oh yeah!

107
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,932
Excellent workout.

108
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,534
I got my rotator cuff rotating.

109
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:11,638
My face feels weird.

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,171
Carlos!

111
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,253
Carlos?

112
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,276
You name your things, I'll name mine.

113
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,419
Well, what about that thing named Bobby?

114
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,981
What are we going to do about him?

115
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,506
He seems bent on destroying everything I own.

116
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,511
Why can't he turn that energy into something useful?

117
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,356
Like that boy with no legs who ran across Canada.

118
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:34,182
Maybe you need to spend some time together, you know, just talking you and Bobby.

119
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:35,764
Mano a mano.

120
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,368
Well, I can't now, I'm going golfing.

121
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,568
Peg, we're riding to full 18 holes today.

122
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,452
You know what that kind of stress can do to a boy?

123
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:52,243
Bobby, I apologize for yelling at you, but sometimes you just don't listen.

124
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:56,168
It's like you got a problem with concentration.

125
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,411
Bobby?

126
00:06:59,412 --> 00:06:59,773
Bobby?

127
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,555
Bobby!

128
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:03,139
Hey!

129
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,481
You just killed me!

130
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:05,703
Well, you needed killing.

131
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,893
You know, I've been thinking, son, and I realized you don't have any goals.

132
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,660
You gotta figure out what you wanna do with your life.

133
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,265
Okay, can we go to Six Flags?

134
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,870
I think you need a role model, Bobby.

135
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,674
Someone to emulate, a hero.

136
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:27,659
Someone besides that broccoli neck.

137
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,661
How about Eddie Stilson?

138
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,383
Can I emulate him?

139
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,346
Now there you go, Eddie Stilson.

140
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,891
Which one's he, the space shuttle astronaut or the stock car champ?

141
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,755
He got to the end of level six and screamed ninja.

142
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:45,807
Bobby, when I say hero, I don't mean some weird Game Boy freak.

143
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:49,371
If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.

144
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:52,354
Deal me out this hand, Jason.

145
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,516
I'm about to bust.

146
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:57,659
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom.

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh, good lord!

148
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:02,785
You know Howard Adderley?

149
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:05,848
He's my number two hero after Eddie Stilson.

150
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,573
Bobby, you need to be lectured all afternoon.

151
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,497
Peggy, I'm taking the boy golfing, and that's that.

152
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,707
Careful now, Peggy.

153
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,349
Betsy isn't strapped in yet.

154
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,933
Oh, do not tell me you are taking that thing golfing with you now.

155
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:28,355
Don't be silly, Peg.

156
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,397
Just bring her in to get fixed.

157
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:31,879
Sit in the middle, son.

158
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,143
I want to make sure Betsy's in front of the airbag.

159
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,731
So Bobby, we gotta think of a hero for you.

160
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:41,154
Do you have a hero, Dad?

161
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,376
I sure do, and it's Willie Nelson.

162
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:44,377
How cool.

163
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:48,042
Well, you might say he's been my inspiration.

164
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:52,687
See, Willie grew up in Texas, and I grew up in Texas.

165
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,790
He loves golfing and playing guitar.

166
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,152
I love golfing and playing guitar.

167
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:05,502
He's had trouble with the IRS, and I must have spent six hours last April on that 1040 form.

168
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:06,998
Easy, my ass.

169
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,346
Do you have a hero like that?

170
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,758
Uh, Willie Nelson?

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,786
You're just saying Willie Nelson because I said Willie Nelson.

172
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,769
No, I like Willie Nelson.

173
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,071
He's got long hair.

174
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:22,773
He's alternative.

175
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,035
Now you take that back.

176
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:32,268
I followed that man from country western to country to adult contemporary and that's as far as I'm going.

177
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,111
Here son, take a look at that.

178
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,357
That's Willie Nelson's own personal golf course.

179
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,645
I am going to show that brain machine who's boss, Aunt Peggy.

180
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:45,667
Go on the wind.

181
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,990
Show this town there's a braider in the family.

182
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:51,395
I'm not scared of you.

183
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,378
This time I'm going to beat you at your own game.

184
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,792
Miss Cramsire!

185
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:07,240
It's the bridge, isn't it?

186
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,224
Well, bridge is the symptom.

187
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,328
Frat asymmetry is the disease.

188
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:15,556
Smells like a belly button.

189
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,281
Yeah, my son was playing it with a piece of cheese.

190
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,545
You mean like celery head?

191
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,653
Look, I'm Camembert Humperdinger.

192
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,918
Les, go in the back and alphabetize the guitar strings.

193
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,362
Now alphabetize by letter or... Les.

194
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:31,343
Okay.

195
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:32,404
All right.

196
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,747
Geez or not, this is a sweet, sweet guitar.

197
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:36,189
Is she for sale?

198
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,071
Not hardly.

199
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,653
Just fix the bridge, Earl.

200
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,315
Oh, I didn't think so.

201
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:45,081
Most guys would sell their wives before they'd sell a guitar like this.

202
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,383
I gotta remember that one.

203
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:49,966
Oh, heck, I got a million of them.

204
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,068
Like, women are a lot like a guitar.

205
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:53,790
They both come with strings attached.

206
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,217
Oh, actually, I guess those are the only two.

207
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,699
Most women will be threatened by Betsy, but not me.

208
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,160
I don't care.

209
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,505
And I would like to see that guitar come home and chicken fry a steak after substitute teaching all day.

210
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,408
Ow.

211
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:13,110
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hellman.

212
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,489
Santa Claus!

213
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,890
What are you talking about?

214
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,112
Santa Claus!

215
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:26,176
He could be the boy's hero in one twenty-four hour period.

216
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:28,759
He delivers toys and enjoyed every child on earth.

217
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,822
Santa Claus is for babies.

218
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,204
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

219
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,595
Damn Russian titanium, my lord.

220
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:57,776
Huh.

221
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,199
Maybe it's just first-hold jitters.

222
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,361
Got any tips, boomhauer?

223
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:02,102
Yeah, man.

224
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,163
I'll tell you what you do, man.

225
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:04,985
You just gotta keep that thing of warm straight, man.

226
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,707
Y'all put your left hand still, man.

227
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,289
Just speed it the hell up.

228
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,210
Let's roll.

229
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,372
Come on, Bobby.

230
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:15,899
Oh, man.

231
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,421
I'm out of cigarettes.

232
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:19,243
This ain't gonna get yoked.

233
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,965
It has to... four.

234
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,147
Mr. Gribble, who's your all-time hero?

235
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,411
You are, if you get me some smokes.

236
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:31,139
So the stripper says to the priest... Build the boy.

237
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:38,791
She says I decided to repent and become a nun.

238
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,155
And I owe a nun.

239
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:44,220
That's pretty funny.

240
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,842
Hey, Dad, watch this.

241
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:47,425
No, no, son, don't.

242
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:50,880
All right, Bobby.

243
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,402
Well, I'll be.

244
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:57,911
Son, you just might be the next Lee Trevino without the crazy accent.

245
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,075
Tell you what, I'm going to let you tee off on this hole.

246
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:01,977
Okay.

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,502
That's okay, Bobby.

248
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:06,143
You can do it.

249
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:10,189
Just choke up on it and swing less like a girl.

250
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:16,740
I get a do-over.

251
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,662
Bobby, hop in.

252
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,044
Hank, dispose of the witnesses.

253
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,187
Dale, come back here.

254
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:27,691
Willie Nelson.

255
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,834
Check his pockets for cigarettes.

256
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,780
Willie Nelson, oh my lord, are you okay?

257
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,282
Am I bleeding from the ears?

258
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:38,922
No.

259
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:41,745
Then I must be okay then.

260
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:45,468
Oh, Mr. Nelson, I am so sorry.

261
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:50,214
My boy is new to golf and oh gosh, I'm your biggest fan.

262
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,036
I go to every concert I can.

263
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:54,578
I've been to every farm aid except one.

264
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,362
I don't much care for that Brian Adams.

265
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,745
Damn, I wish I had my guitar here with me for you to sign.

266
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:07,092
Here, why don't you make it out to, let's say, to my best friend.

267
00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:12,238
No, no, I don't want you to lie to my good friend.

268
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,401
Hmm.

269
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:16,146
To my number one fan, Hank Hill.

270
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,451
Uh, hey, hey, Willie.

271
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:19,995
You know, I play guitar too.

272
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:24,484
I also play golf, but you already know that.

273
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:28,493
But you probably don't know you're, uh, you're my hero.

274
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:30,497
He took our cart.

275
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,895
Was he bleeding from the ears?

276
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:32,676
No.

277
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,239
Well, he must be okay then.

278
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,001
You don't understand, Peg.

279
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,108
A man only gets a chance to meet Willie Nelson once in his life.

280
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,131
It's supposed to be special.

281
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:46,718
We meet on the golf course, he compliments my perfect swing.

282
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:53,369
We start talking about music, cut an album, go on tour, open a chicken franchise.

283
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,692
How's that gonna happen now?

284
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,797
It's my fault forever, taking the boy with me.

285
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:01,026
I said I was sorry.

286
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,512
Um, are you Hank Hill?

287
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,597
Uh, yes.

288
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:08,945
I'm tired of being lack of focus.

289
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,930
I'm gonna show them I can do better.

290
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,874
I'm gonna make my dad proud.

291
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,545
I'm gonna not tell dad about that.

292
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,014
Hey, is that Ben Crenshaw Turbo Golf?

293
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,336
Yeah.

294
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,799
I can never get it past the bunker on the third hole.

295
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,623
Try letting it go just below the mark on your drive.

296
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:52,045
Hey, I know you.

297
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,547
You're the kid that rakes my lawn.

298
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,650
No, I'm the kid who hit you in the head.

299
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,491
With a rake?

300
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,113
No, with a golf club.

301
00:15:58,393 --> 00:16:00,136
You've been raking my yard with a golf club?

302
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:01,097
I want my quarter back.

303
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:04,742
Hill residents?

304
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,005
Dad, guess where I am?

305
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:08,339
I don't know, let's see.

306
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,542
Crushing Dwight Yoakum's voice box with my five iron?

307
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,846
I'm at Willie Nelson's, and he wants you to come over!

308
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,548
Son, you're teasing the gorilla in the monkey house.

309
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:18,689
Willie Nelson here.

310
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,893
Practically blind in one eye now, but I got your son here.

311
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:24,475
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Nelson.

312
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,778
Bobby's never stalked anyone before, and he's not very good at it.

313
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,381
I mean, well, he shouldn't be stalking anybody.

314
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,503
I'll come get him right away.

315
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:45,196
Bobby?

316
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:46,197
Bobby?

317
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,221
Outta my way, rooster boy.

318
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:53,129
Betsy?

319
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,272
What the?

320
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:57,015
Hey, Dad!

321
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:57,496
Hey, Hank.

322
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,338
Bobby's been telling me all about you.

323
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:03,004
I hear you're a guitar player, and that you got a narrow urethra.

324
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:03,766
Bobby?

325
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:05,769
Yeah, and he had me autograph your guitar.

326
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,472
You signed my guitar?

327
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:10,236
To my number one fan, Willie Nelson.

328
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,507
The fox chases the rabbit around the tree trunk and gets into the house.

329
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:19,849
I was so close.

330
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,490
Hill residents.

331
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,832
Peggy, you'll never guess.

332
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:23,574
I'm at Willie Nelson's house.

333
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,077
He says we're all invited to his barbecue.

334
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:29,561
Gee, I'd love to come, Hank, but Ann Richards and I are doing our toenails.

335
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:30,863
I don't think so, Peggy.

336
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:34,527
I'm looking at Ann Richards right now and she's playing tetherball with one of my roadies.

337
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:35,989
See, that was him.

338
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,193
Oh, my lord, what do I wear?

339
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,204
Peg, where any old thing?

340
00:17:41,545 --> 00:17:45,433
Oh, just don't forget to bring Betsy's orange woven shoulder strap.

341
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:48,258
Betsy sure is a beaut, Hank.

342
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:49,641
I think Trigger's getting jealous.

343
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:51,004
Well, thank you, Willie.

344
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,908
Sure means a lot coming from you.

345
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,872
You know what they say?

346
00:17:54,892 --> 00:18:00,203
I'd sell my wife before I'd sell my guitar.

347
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,804
I tell you what, man, you did that dang ol' mid-mid-midst of the tambourine, man.

348
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:10,511
Somebody did come play a song for me, you know, then you got to change your name to Zimmerman, y'all born again.

349
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:16,798
Well, a whole bunch of kids coming around and, hey, mad dog, ten of them going platinum.

350
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:20,442
You know those accounting firms and that dang ol' boomer.

351
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:24,307
Uh, ma'am, you're gonna want to angle that glass.

352
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,970
Uh-uh, you're blowing it.

353
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,975
You're gonna get nothing but foam.

354
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:31,135
Mm-hmm.

355
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,611
You know, Mr. Hopper, I just loved you in that movie.

356
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:40,214
You know, the one where you played a mad villain.

357
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:42,136
Come on, Peggy, you wild thing.

358
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,639
Let's drive straight down to Mexico, huh?

359
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:45,800
Come on, right this minute.

360
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,021
Mexico.

361
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:50,105
I wonder what a wife goes for down there, huh?

362
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,567
One guitar, two guitars.

363
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:55,932
I will have to ask Hank.

364
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,254
Los Mariachi's so deablos.

365
00:18:58,474 --> 00:18:59,956
He's not treating you right, Peggy.

366
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,539
A delicate flower like you.

367
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,371
You want me to kick his ass?

368
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,277
Oh, you are so sweet to offer, Dennis.

369
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,542
But Hank would flatten you out like a bug.

370
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,831
No, this is something Peggy Hill has to handle on her own.

371
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,534
Oh yeah!

372
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,817
Haha, you go girl!

373
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:22,890
That's some boy you got there, Hank.

374
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:27,919
Well, it's nice of you to say that, Willie.

375
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,443
But Bobby's got no direction in life.

376
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:31,544
No heroes.

377
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,308
When I was his age, I worshipped you.

378
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:37,192
And Jesus, of course.

379
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:38,594
Ever think you're too tough on the boy?

380
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,736
Oh, I don't know.

381
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:48,268
Just today, he chipped Betsy's bridge, ran into my truck with the mower, dinged up my favorite wedge, and then dinged you up worse.

382
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:49,750
Well, now hold on there, Hank.

383
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,471
You think about it.

384
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:55,678
Bobby wants to play your guitar, ride your mower, and swing your golf club.

385
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:59,283
I believe that kid does have a hero, and his name is Hank Hall.

386
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,006
Uh, Hill.

387
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,087
Uh, yeah, right.

388
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:03,329
Bobby?

389
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:05,392
Bobby?

390
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:06,573
Bobby!

391
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,675
What?

392
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:14,565
I just want to, uh, thank you for helping me meet my hero and having him sign my guitar.

393
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,768
I helped him put Whiteman in his eye.

394
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:21,835
Now I'm gonna show you something you can do with a guitar that doesn't involve cheese.

395
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,944
This is a song I wrote a long time ago.

396
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:33,237
Well, I know a gal with the purdy legs.

397
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,283
She's a gal who can fry my eggs.

398
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:41,090
And her name is Peggy.

399
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:48,582
Well, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy.

400
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,231
my pig leg.

401
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:56,475
Well, I love you and I love you, Peggy Pig.

402
00:20:56,495 --> 00:21:00,619
Well, uh, then it just sort of goes off into a buddy holly riff.

403
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,321
Oh, Hank.

404
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:06,044
Peggy, oh, I didn't realize you were there.

405
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:08,266
Here, Bobby, go practice.

406
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,747
Are you sure it's okay for me?

407
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:09,947
Yeah.

408
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,831
You know, I was headed over here to knock you six ways from Sunday with that guitar.

409
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:17,674
Then I get here and you're playing that old song years and

410
00:21:18,582 --> 00:21:20,305
out.

411
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:25,876
I love you, propane man.

412
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:35,494
You braided that perfect lumen, but next time lighten up a little on the glitter spray.

413
00:21:42,359 --> 00:22:03,673
He's got hold of this a little longer before we go ahead.

414
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,556
Now?

415
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,683
That's a good start.
