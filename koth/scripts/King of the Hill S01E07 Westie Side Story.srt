1
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,119
Hey, look at that.

2
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,831
Well, I guess we're finally getting some new neighbors.

3
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:30,668
I tell you, if that boy handles the football half as good as he handles the cardboard box, Arlen High's got herself a new tight end.

4
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,432
Hey, you think the dad's a good bowler?

5
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,354
Yeah, he looks like a good bowler.

6
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,497
Maybe he needs someone to bowl with.

7
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,634
Notice how he lifts with his legs.

8
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:43,321
I think they're gonna fit in just fine.

9
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:44,625
Howdy fellas.

10
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:46,350
What brings you to Ireland?

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,478
Well, uh, this family hired us to move their stuff.

12
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:33,803
Well, I'll be damned.

13
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:35,745
They look Japanese.

14
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:36,126
Nope.

15
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,888
I think they're Chinese.

16
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,089
How can you tell?

17
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,255
Japanese guys usually have glasses and a suit and a tie and stuff like that.

18
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:45,396
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,078
Well, a neighbor's a neighbor.

20
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,900
Let's go over and say hi.

21
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,403
You reckon they even speak English?

22
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:53,005
Yeah, man, them Chinese, man.

23
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,687
You can't understand a word they say, man.

24
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:57,450
They just try to listen to the whole upside down whatnot.

25
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,880
Hi there, I'm Hank Hill.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,645
I live next door, which means I'm your neighbor and you're my friend.

27
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,812
I think you'll find we have a great little community here.

28
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,795
What do you think of it so far?

29
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:13,278
I am Khan, Super Newsome Bone.

30
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,485
Hmm, so that's pronounced... Khan, right?

31
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:18,827
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,315
What the hell are you trying to do?

33
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,900
So are you Chinese or Japanese?

34
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:32,686
I lived in California last 20 years, but first come from Laos.

35
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:33,967
Huh?

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,468
Laos.

37
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:35,790
We lay ocean.

38
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,871
The ocean?

39
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:37,973
What ocean?

40
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,054
We all lay ocean!

41
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:40,556
From Laos, stupid!

42
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,880
It's a landlocked country in Southeast Asia.

43
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,882
It's between Vietnam and Thailand, okay?

44
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,025
Population, 4.7 million.

45
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:52,513
So are you Chinese or Japanese?

46
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,957
That is so very exciting.

47
00:02:55,458 --> 00:03:01,547
It's like we get to travel to the Orient without having to worry about diarrhea or being jailed for our pro-democracy beliefs.

48
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:11,183
You know, at the beauty academy, they teach us that people aren't black or white or yellow or red, but their hair can be.

49
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,727
I'm going to invite our new neighbors to dinner.

50
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,611
We can't expect them to break the eyes.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,527
These people are by nature shy and reserved.

52
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:25,061
I read somewhere that the Chinese language has 72 words for us, but no word for friend.

53
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,069
Howdy, you all.

54
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:29,534
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

55
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:30,275
Yeah.

56
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:31,657
Can you believe this crap?

57
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:34,320
You want to live in this country, learn to speak English.

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,321
I'm not going.

59
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,623
But you promise.

60
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,484
Why go?

61
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,808
I could just stay home, order a bucket of chicken and watch Hee-Haw.

62
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:41,649
Same thing.

63
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,033
Khan, please, for once, try not to piss off neighbor.

64
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,555
We kick out of Laos.

65
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,217
We kick out of Anaheim.

66
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,599
I'm tired of running.

67
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,124
Hello, Khan.

68
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,684
Oh, damn.

69
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:57,364
Damn.

70
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,068
Oh, you have damn fine house.

71
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,070
Lead-free since 1988.

72
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,614
This is my wife, Meen, and daughter, Con Junior.

73
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:08,037
And this is Peggy Hill.

74
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:13,003
On behalf of Arlen, Texas, I would like to welcome you to our country.

75
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:16,687
Now, please make yourselves at home and take off your shoes.

76
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:17,468
Wait.

77
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:21,333
You just shampoo carpet?

78
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:22,254
Come on, Bobby.

79
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,215
Have some seconds.

80
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:24,837
The girl's lapping you.

81
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,082
I've never had beef chop suey before.

82
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:27,863
Really?

83
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:29,365
Oh, you poor dear.

84
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:35,554
You know, I read somewhere that in certain parts of China, meat is as scarce as toilet paper.

85
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:37,216
Well, where you read that?

86
00:04:37,617 --> 00:04:38,498
Oh, who can remember?

87
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,383
You know, as a substitute teacher, I have to review all sorts of learning materials.

88
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,246
My beat was on a placement.

89
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,608
So you're a teacher?

90
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,373
Maybe you can tell me why art and test scores are so low.

91
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,155
I know why.

92
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:54,520
It's because Khan Junior not there to bring up average.

93
00:04:54,989 --> 00:05:00,555
You know, my boy here might not be the best test taker, but he's got near perfect attendance.

94
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:01,416
Tell him, Bobby.

95
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,841
I hope you all save some room for my famous apple brown Betty.

96
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,864
The recipe is a closely guarded family secret.

97
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,188
Passed on from my mother's mother to my mother to me.

98
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:14,891
And someday, I will give it to my Bobby.

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,735
Well, at least the brown Betty was good.

100
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,229
You must give me recipe.

101
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,813
Oh, man, you know I can't do that.

102
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,536
But what I can do is offer you some leftovers.

103
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,960
Here, now just reheat this for 10 minutes.

104
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,584
I have already said way too much.

105
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,307
Well, y'all come back now, you hear?

106
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,771
That's Texan for Sayonara.

107
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,174
Oh my, Peggy here.

108
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,659
What big feet you have, like boat.

109
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,542
Well, that's just the way God made me.

110
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:48,973
Hey, look at me!

111
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:50,879
I'm like little girl in mama's shoes!

112
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:55,253
Okay, bye-bye now, bye-bye!

113
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,700
Now, honey, she didn't mean anything, bud.

114
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,206
You do not come into a woman's home and insult her fate.

115
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:02,247
You just don't.

116
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,369
Oh, come on, Peg.

117
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,153
Remember when you first moved here from Montana?

118
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:09,658
He called Pops so depop.

119
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:12,422
And you thought 93 in the shade was hot.

120
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:14,766
Our new neighbors are just like you.

121
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:19,052
All they need is a little bit of time and Hank Hill to watch out for them.

122
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,555
Well, do you think my feet are too big?

123
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,700
No, there's just more of you to love.

124
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,732
Ow.

125
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:27,414
Sorry.

126
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:36,795
Be careful, Bobby.

127
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,381
That's one of them Chinese fighting dogs.

128
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:41,158
Oh, it's a West Highland Terrier.

129
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:42,660
Yeah, that's it.

130
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,582
So what's his name?

131
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:44,443
Doggy.

132
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,707
Yes, Con Junior, he's a doggy.

133
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,170
Now, can you tell me his name?

134
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,292
He's called Doggy.

135
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:53,278
And that's called a doggy too, but her name is Lady Bird.

136
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,063
She's a purebred Georgia bloodhound.

137
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,507
Her momma tracked down James Earl Wraith.

138
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,651
Yeah!

139
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,993
Uh, aren't kids great?

140
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:06,041
They're too young to know about fear or prejudice.

141
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,407
They won't have to learn that till high school.

142
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:12,276
Yep, there's a real lesson here for all of us.

143
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:12,978
Move, please.

144
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,481
You're standing on my hose.

145
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:23,767
Dad, look, Lady Bird and Doggy like each other.

146
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:24,908
Of course they do, son.

147
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:25,589
They're neighbors.

148
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,534
You know, Con, I just found a breeding partner for my Lady Bird.

149
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:34,259
If you're interested in having a real American dog, I can give... What the hell?

150
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,220
Get him off!

151
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,662
Get him off of her!

152
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:38,704
Your Lady Bird!

153
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,765
She's real slut!

154
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:41,728
Lady Bird is not a slut.

155
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,009
She is in heat.

156
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,134
Her hormones have overwhelmed her natural modesty.

157
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,198
For Pete's sake, would you tie up your dog?

158
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:52,380
You tie your dog?

159
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,642
She seduced my doggy.

160
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:54,705
That's ridiculous.

161
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,452
Lady Bird can only love another purebred Georgia bloodhound.

162
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,456
You know what I think, Hank Hill?

163
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,480
I think you a narrow-minded redneck.

164
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,321
Oh, I get it.

165
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:06,548
Just because I'm from Texas, I gotta be some kind of redneck.

166
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,514
Chinese and their stupid stereotypes.

167
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,776
Get out my property!

168
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,319
Sorry, Lady Bird.

169
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:23,974
I know you didn't mean to, uh, have relations with that dog, but I gotta tie you up anyway, if only to protect your virtue and good name.

170
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,156
Well, hey, look there.

171
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:39,617
Maybe Con will let you borrow his sexy little import.

172
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:44,305
I'd cut my entire quarter acre with the lady bick before I'd borrow that man's mower.

173
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:45,867
I just don't like him.

174
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:46,549
Why?

175
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,091
Because he's Chinese?

176
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:48,612
No.

177
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:49,854
It's always great.

178
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,917
What the hell's the difference?

179
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:53,179
I don't like the man.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,443
That has nothing to do with where he's from.

181
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,925
I'm no redneck.

182
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:59,089
He could be from Mars for all I care.

183
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,835
Believe me, Hank, if Con were from Mars, you'd care.

184
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:08,906
Especially after he's stolen every last drop of earth's drinkable water to transport back to his home planet.

185
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,250
Mars.

186
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:13,955
Come up, stop dawdling the wind.

187
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,341
We've got to pick up that pizza before the cheese gets cold and the pineapple gets hot.

188
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,664
What's the rush?

189
00:09:19,164 --> 00:09:21,128
If we're not there in 30 minutes, it's free.

190
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,591
Peggy here!

191
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,113
Peggy here!

192
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,215
Wait, Peggy, it's me.

193
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:29,198
Stop.

194
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:30,460
Oh, my man.

195
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,383
I almost did not see you there.

196
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:33,985
Peggy here.

197
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,930
I feel deeply, deeply sorry about dinner.

198
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,713
We get off to bad start.

199
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,956
I see things I should only have thought.

200
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,255
Oh, Min.

201
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:43,557
Thank you.

202
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,063
I mean, it must have taken a lot of courage to apologize like that.

203
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,105
And I know.

204
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,229
I was once the new girl in town myself.

205
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:50,910
Me?

206
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,611
Khan?

207
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:53,955
Khan Junior have a barbecue tomorrow.

208
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,778
It means so much if you come.

209
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,120
Well, thank you, Min.

210
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,483
We would be honored to come.

211
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:04,513
And if you need any help with the barbecue, or if you just want to know what a barbecue is, you give me a call.

212
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,300
Uh-uh, Peggy.

213
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:09,241
I can't go.

214
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:09,762
I won't.

215
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,426
Not after what he said about Lady Bird.

216
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,008
Oh, Hank, come on.

217
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:15,790
Now, Min and I just made up.

218
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:16,912
We have to go.

219
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,357
And if you stay home, people will think you don't like Conn just because he's Oriental.

220
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,619
That is ridiculous.

221
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,483
I hate the man because he's rude and nasty.

222
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:29,148
Not because of what his people did to us in WW2.

223
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,429
Well, Hank, I know that.

224
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,994
But everyone else, they'll say Hank Hill is a racist.

225
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:38,362
What the hell kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?

226
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:44,072
Hank Hill, you will go to that party, you will pretend to like con, and you will drink until you actually do.

227
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,861
Go on.

228
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,708
Uh, howdy, Conn.

229
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:53,850
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

230
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:54,772
Here you go.

231
00:10:55,594 --> 00:11:00,464
I thought you might enjoy 7.5 gallons of pure premium propane.

232
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:01,366
Are you kidding?

233
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,250
No, I cook with mesquite.

234
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,635
Give meat a nice taste of wood.

235
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,998
And I cook with propane.

236
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,123
Gives meat a nice taste of meat.

237
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,225
Thank you.

238
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,070
Hey, whatever.

239
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,933
Some cultures like mesquite, some prefer propane.

240
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,755
Doesn't mean we can't all get along.

241
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:21,321
Just because I happen to sell propane and propane accessories... Okay, all right.

242
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:22,562
Go stick tank on the table.

243
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,324
Keep napkins from blowing away.

244
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,926
Con, super news upon.

245
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:27,528
Ah, okay.

246
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:31,472
You honor me by giving me gas.

247
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:32,453
Doggy's just like me.

248
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:35,436
He's new in town and he's only got one friend.

249
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,010
But at least you're not tied up.

250
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:41,777
If I were, I'd just dislocate my shoulders and slip out of the knot.

251
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,459
I'd chew through the leash.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,124
I bet it tastes just like a Bible cover.

253
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,009
Hey, let's untie them.

254
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,392
They belong together.

255
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,776
And it's fun to watch them play piggyback.

256
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:54,599
There you go, boy.

257
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,242
Go play with Lady Bird.

258
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:58,065
Be with your true love.

259
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:04,303
Wait!

260
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,247
Come back!

261
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:12,021
You're in love!

262
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,970
Oh look, it's Piggy here, my new best friend!

263
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:20,196
She's so pretty in her little yellow sundress.

264
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:22,780
Oh man, you are so sweet.

265
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,165
I could just mix you up in some jello and eat you for dessert.

266
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,729
Oh Piggy here, look at husbands.

267
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,233
Too bad men don't get along like we do.

268
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:32,475
We get along?

269
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,077
Man, stupid.

270
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:38,685
Women's smart mm-hmm the whole world over hey Peggy here.

271
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,329
Look what I make Peggy here brown Betty.

272
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,413
Oh, but that's impossible.

273
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:48,040
I never gave you the oh Where'd you get my granny's recipe?

274
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,631
I figured out myself and then make it better her recipe missing one thing Flavor I thank your Pete.

275
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:57,496
I add flavor not make flavor now tastes much better.

276
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:58,798
Don't you think Peggy here?

277
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,025
Please try a Piggy Brown Betty.

278
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:03,369
Would you like a Piggy Brown Betty?

279
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:03,609
It's tasty.

280
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,150
Delicious.

281
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:09,458
While Piggy, to be honest, I have always had trouble keeping your brown Betty down, but this here is pure heaven.

282
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,426
Those burgers look pretty done to me.

283
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:15,307
Not yet.

284
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,691
You might want to turn them now.

285
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:18,592
Too soon.

286
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:19,514
Okay.

287
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:25,663
Uh... Whoa.

288
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,517
You might want to turn them now.

289
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:30,378
No.

290
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:31,178
Please go away.

291
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:32,820
Please, Con, you're burning them.

292
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,222
That's too much char.

293
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:40,568
Shut mouth and open mouth.

294
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:40,648
Oh.

295
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:40,748
Hmm.

296
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:41,729
Boy, howdy.

297
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,993
That is the best damn burger I ever ate.

298
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,557
Stop, stop pushing.

299
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,678
That's enough for everyone.

300
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:53,061
If three of you go home right now, ha ha ha.

301
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:54,423
Joke.

302
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:56,105
Doggy.

303
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:56,545
Doggy.

304
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:58,039
Con Junior?

305
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:58,981
Yeah?

306
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,284
Why are you named Con Junior?

307
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:02,926
My father wanted a boy.

308
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,529
Yeah, so did mine.

309
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:06,011
My dad is so lame.

310
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,675
He makes me practice violin five hours a day.

311
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,060
My dad won't let me watch TV more than five hours a day.

312
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,206
Well, my dad's making me memorize 2,000 words for the SAT.

313
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:17,948
He's such an autocrat.

314
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,233
What's a SAT?

315
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:25,966
I tell you, Peggy, there's nothing these people can't make better.

316
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:30,651
First the automobile, then the color TV, and now the hamburger.

317
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,093
How do they do it?

318
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:34,356
With a dash of nutmeg, Hank.

319
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,497
A dash of nutmeg.

320
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:36,678
Oh, Peggy here!

321
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:40,002
Your husband likes burgers so much, I give you a recipe.

322
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:41,504
Now you can please him.

323
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:48,212
I don't care what country he's from, any man who can make a burger like that is okay by me.

324
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:50,595
Oh, you said it.

325
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:56,228
Boy, it was so good, it's almost a shame to lose it to the process of digestion.

326
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,113
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, the dang old onion soup powder, man.

327
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,097
Just put that little bit old ab you don't need old grilled onions, man.

328
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,259
How about you, Dale?

329
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,621
How many you got under your belt?

330
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:05,503
Zero.

331
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:06,164
Huh?

332
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:07,005
How come?

333
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,629
Don't eat dog.

334
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:16,720
Okay.

335
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,245
Here are the facts as I see them.

336
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,618
Khan served your dog.

337
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,901
Khan did not serve us dog.

338
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,264
That's just an awful stereotype.

339
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:28,426
Chinese people don't really do that.

340
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:29,227
Well, I don't know.

341
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:32,651
Anyone crazy enough to put nutmeg in brown Betty?

342
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,713
Well, they'd be crazy enough to do anything.

343
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:38,938
Hey, even if they did feed us dog, you know, who are we?

344
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,140
Who are we to judge other cultures?

345
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,722
You know, maybe they're on to something.

346
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:46,009
They did invent paper, you know.

347
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,330
Quit talking like that.

348
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,512
Dog is man's best friend.

349
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,474
You wouldn't eat your best friend, would you?

350
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:52,555
Of course not.

351
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,138
Wait, are we talking about some kind of lifeboat situation here?

352
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,080
Because I don't want to paint myself into a corner.

353
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,962
Look, I can settle this right now.

354
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,684
That woman gave us a recipe.

355
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:01,845
See?

356
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:02,526
Right here.

357
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,008
It says chopped meat, not chopped dog.

358
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,430
Dog is meat.

359
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:07,891
Mm.

360
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:08,812
You said it, friend.

361
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:11,755
Oh.

362
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:14,278
I was just trying to get that awful taste off my fingers.

363
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:29,225
Doggy?

364
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,068
Doggy?

365
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:31,588
Hello?

366
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:32,690
Dog pound?

367
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,691
Yes, hello?

368
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:36,394
I'm looking for dog.

369
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,936
Sweet, sweet dog.

370
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,839
Have big barbecue today and dog run out.

371
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,302
All about 20, 25 pound.

372
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,024
Good lord, it's true.

373
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,347
Oh, I'll call you back.

374
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:48,348
Hey, Kill.

375
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:49,569
What a nice surprise.

376
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,111
Hey, Khan, come quick.

377
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,613
Your best friend is here.

378
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:53,454
Oh, no.

379
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:54,996
Uh, that's OK.

380
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:57,158
What are you doing here?

381
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,834
I can't hear you over my weed, Parker.

382
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,997
Hey, where you going, kiddo?

383
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:04,578
Stop!

384
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:05,680
I can't hear you.

385
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,082
My good tentamom!

386
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:08,945
What you doing?

387
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,667
You ruined my yard!

388
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,129
You crazy redneck!

389
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:13,011
That's a niff!

390
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,057
We're never gonna find Doggie.

391
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,219
I know.

392
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,021
Wanna ride bikes?

393
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:24,187
Hey, Lady Bird's a bloodhound.

394
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,850
Maybe she can find Doggie.

395
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,212
Yeah!

396
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:28,989
Come on, Lady Bird.

397
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,258
Lead us to Doggie.

398
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,527
My God, Dale, you were right.

399
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:48,789
Their dog is gone.

400
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:49,871
All gone.

401
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:53,195
I caught men on the phone with some kind of doggy butcher.

402
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,298
She was placing an order.

403
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:56,700
This is very dangerous.

404
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,142
They know that you know.

405
00:17:58,383 --> 00:17:59,885
And now they gotta come after you.

406
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:00,626
They do?

407
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,067
Yep.

408
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:03,170
They'll probably get you with a blow dart.

409
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,051
That's their way.

410
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,154
But you'll just think it's a mosquito bite.

411
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:08,958
Until you die, then you'll know the truth.

412
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:09,358
Why?

413
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,640
Why would they shoot people?

414
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,543
Human meat's tough, flavorless.

415
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:15,407
They should be out hunting for more dog.

416
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,704
Good God!

417
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:25,393
He's got Lady Bird!

418
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,354
It's still wet.

419
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,716
Maybe there's time.

420
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:30,340
Come on guys, we gotta save Lady Bird.

421
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:34,906
Gah!

422
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:35,628
I've been hit!

423
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:36,769
Quick!

424
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,712
Somebody suck out the poison!

425
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,457
Oh no!

426
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,696
Lady Bird!

427
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,071
Whoa.

428
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:02,753
That psycho Redneck is back.

429
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,214
Why, he's so mad.

430
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:05,756
You do something wrong?

431
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,898
You're the one who insulted his propane.

432
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,861
You're the one who made fun of Peggy Hill's monster feet.

433
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,722
Open up, Con.

434
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:13,583
Open up now.

435
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:14,584
Get my bat.

436
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:15,965
I know you're in there.

437
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,186
Go away.

438
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,548
I do nothing wrong.

439
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:26,675
Look, Con, I understand that life is valued differently in your part of the world, largely as a result of overcrowding and famine.

440
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:29,438
But you're in my country now.

441
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,559
You're a crazy man.

442
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,760
I call the police.

443
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,422
If anyone's going to be calling the police, it's going to be me.

444
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:35,323
Police?

445
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:36,744
What do you want from me?

446
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:38,946
I want my lady bird.

447
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,167
You understand me?

448
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,269
Give me my dog back or else.

449
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,911
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

450
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:44,911
Tough guy.

451
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:46,173
I'm so scared.

452
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:47,694
You want a piece of this?

453
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,595
Dad, no!

454
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:49,676
It's all our fault.

455
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,917
We lost the dogs.

456
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:55,621
They wanted to play with each other, so we untied them, and they ran away, and now we can't find them.

457
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:56,522
You what?

458
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,243
You mean you...

459
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:01,081
The, the dogs, they're still alive?

460
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,683
What do you think happened?

461
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,885
Well, I, uh, nothing.

462
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:06,347
We're sorry, Dad.

463
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,749
We looked everywhere.

464
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,030
We really did.

465
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,693
Bobby, you really screwed up this time.

466
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:14,417
Con, Junior, you fought in with a bad crowd.

467
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,259
You made me fight with my neighbor.

468
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,081
You made the neighbor man crazy.

469
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,142
Go to your room!

470
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:23,387
What, you say, go to your room?

471
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:25,827
I say, go to your room.

472
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,009
You spank?

473
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:27,931
No, sir.

474
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,253
Don't believe in it.

475
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,596
No, me neither.

476
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:31,597
I think it barbaric.

477
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,901
How about bed without dessert?

478
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,065
Never fail.

479
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:36,165
Huh.

480
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:40,894
Wouldn't figure a child could be motivated by a fortune cookie and an orange slice.

481
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,983
Oh, the cookie may be small, but it contains great wisdom.

482
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,208
And orange is sweet and juicy.

483
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:55,037
You know, Con, we may deny our kids completely different desserts, but they both go to bed hungry.

484
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,941
And that's what really matters.

485
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:01,666
Well, I guess we're not so different after all.

486
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:03,529
Boy, howdy.

487
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:03,689
Woo!

488
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,132
Woo!

489
00:21:06,152 --> 00:21:06,233
Woo!

490
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,875
Woo!

491
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:08,195
Woo!

492
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:09,156
Woo!

493
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:09,938
Woo!

494
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,038
Woo!

495
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:10,138
Woo!

496
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:10,238
Woo!

497
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:10,338
Woo!

498
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:10,438
Woo!

499
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:10,538
Woo!

500
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:10,638
Woo!

501
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:10,739
Woo!

502
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:10,839
Woo!

503
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:10,939
Woo!

504
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:11,039
Woo!

505
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:11,139
Woo!

506
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:11,239
Woo!

507
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:11,339
Woo!

508
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:11,460
Woo!

509
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,560
Woo!

510
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:11,660
Woo!

511
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,760
Woo!

512
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:11,960
Woo!

513
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,140
Woo!

514
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,361
Woo!

515
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:12,461
Woo!

516
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:12,561
Woo!

517
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:19,423
Welcome to the neighborhood, con su panusan pon.

518
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:20,325
Just call me con.

519
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:25,675
I don't got all damn day.

520
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:26,957
I'm running out of time.

521
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:30,263
Give me the antidote, man.

522
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,659
This is my granny's five alarm jambalaya.

523
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:51,350
You want less hot, more spicy, add nutmeg.

524
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,094
Less hot, more spicy, add nutmeg, of course.

525
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:54,495
Okay.

526
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,818
Aunt Laverne's chicken fried chicken.

527
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,187
Too much Mrs. Dash, add nutmeg.

528
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,652
And this here is my very own rabbit stew.

529
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:08,096
Rabbit?

530
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,919
You rednecks will eat anything.
