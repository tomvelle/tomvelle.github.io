You want potatoes with that buck?
You know I do, Miss Bible.
Scattered, smothered, covered.
Hank'll have a seam.
Actually, uh, I prefer my potatoes diced and chunked.
I already ordered for you, now listen up.
Team Recomers is putting together a co-ed softball league.
I want you to play and be head coach.
Head coach?
Like Tom Landry?
I'm gonna need a moment here, sir.
What you got, Buck?
Vanilla milkshake?
Doctor wants you to put on another 40 pounds?
Get out of here, Fatheton.
Oh, where are my manners?
Allow me to introduce the newest dispatcher at Fatheton Fuels, Mrs. Rita Bavaqua.
Bavaqua, huh.
Is that any relation to former Texas Rangers' third baseman, Kurt Bavaqua?
Kurt's my husband, by marriage.
A Chamber of Commerce rulebook says immediate family is eligible to play.
Husband falls under the category of immediate family, don't it, boys?
Latherton!
I hope my picture isn't at the edge of the page.
Last year it just said Connie Soup.
Yeah, but I could still tell it was you, even without the Hanoosen poem.
You're so sweet, Bobby.
I can't help it.
You guys are a couple.
Can you believe they put that picture in there?
Yeah.
Can you believe it?
Hank, what are you doing here?
Did Bobby do something to his eye?
No, no, no.
Strickland propane is going to have a softball team, and I was named the head coach.
Well, congratulations, Hank.
My game went well.
Thank you so much for asking.
Here's the best part.
It's a co-ed league with a woman must pitch rule, so you'll be pitching for team Strickland.
But I already pitched for a team hang.
The Lady Giants?
But this is a chance to play in a serious league against men.
See how you do against batters who can really put some aluminum into the ball.
I am in a serious league, Hank.
Of course, you wouldn't know how serious, because you've never come to one of my games.
Peggy, you know that Tuesday's my night to drink beer in the alley with the guys?
It has been for years.
See, I got Enrique at shortstop, and Joe Jack in center field.
I'll have to put Mr. Strickland at catcher.
It's the only position his cardiologist would clear him to play.
And he has to sit on a stool.
I wish you could coach my armist softball team, Hank.
We don't have any good leaders.
That's classified.
This chamber of commie, Earth's League, discriminates against the self-employed.
I'm a one-man extermination corporation.
How am I supposed to play?
Those are the rules, Dale.
You gotta have a Strickland paystub or be a Strickland wife.
I've sprayed Strickland for termites.
I have a paystub.
I'm on the team!
I'm on the team!
Get your arrow, girl, cookies.
Hey Connie, wanna see me do a... What a dork.
My mom spent two hours stacking those boxes.
God milk?
Cause you got cookies.
Am I right?
Connie, tell your boyfriend to go away.
He's hurting business.
Just because we're on the couples page doesn't mean he's my boyfriend.
I know that.
I just came to buy a box of Herald Girl cookies.
These cookies stink.
They're waxy and stale.
Bobby, maybe you should
Alright Debbie, fire one in there.
Let's see what Joe Jack's got.
Get out of here, baby.
Alright, somebody pick up the dang ball.
Back it up fellas, I'm going deep.
Ah, darn it!
Hey, give me a boost up this thing, too, will you?
Oh, shoot!
Ah, I'm gonna get that some, bitch.
Mr. Strickland, sir, throw the dang ball.
Oh, I got him.
I got him.
Oh, shoot, I'm having an abortion.
Oh, my god, Mr. Strickland.
Yeah!
You know, my offer's still open.
We could really use a good picture, I tell you what.
Hmm, because if you can pitch as good as you make cookies... My answer is still no, and Bobby baked them.
What?
I used double the butter, aren't they great?
Better than the Arrow Girls!
Oh, God, you didn't join the Arrow Girls, did you?
No, and I never will.
But I will sell more cookies than troop number 159, Connie Supernoose and Bone Secretary Treasurer.
Just don't wear the apron out of the house, please.
Okay, Hank, I drove you here and I helped you carry the bats.
They seem light enough for one person, but what's done is done.
Yeah, well, as long as you're here, maybe you could give Debbie some pointers on pitching.
Here, I brought your mitt.
Goodbye, honey.
Now I know what stinks so bad.
Strickland's pitching.
Oh, what can he do?
The league requires a woman pitcher.
Unlike I tell my gym class, girls can't play sports.
At least I found one that can get it over the plate, if you know what I mean.
I'm having sex with her.
Well, she's no good at sports, right?
Damn it, Gene.
Oh yeah!
I am saving my good stuff for our first game.
What up?
One down!
A strikeout for Peggy Hill!
Yeah!
Oh, sit down now.
Yeah, Peggy!
Fifteen strikeouts for Peggy Hill!
And your winner is the Strictly Bomb Kills!
All right.
You know, this team didn't coach itself.
He's right.
Nice job, Hank.
Oh man, did you see that second bun I laid down?
Lay through your about 20 feet, you sweet gazelle.
All right, quiet down team.
Okay, I'd like to say a few words as coach.
That was a good team effort out there, everybody.
Joe Jack, you got yourself a couple RBIs, nice going.
Enrique, dynamite job of catching.
Aren't you forgetting someone, coach?
All right, all right.
I might be a little biased, but I did coach one heck of a game.
I'll tell you what.
So thank you and enjoy your pizza.
And not one of my beauty school credits has transferred to junior college.
It turns out you have to get at least a say.
Never hurts to quit.
I'm hungry.
Where's dad?
Probably busy patting himself on the back for giving birth to you.
Morning.
Time to flip them.
They're not ready yet.
They're brown around the edges, Peggy.
You don't want to burn them.
Hank, I have been flapping jacks for 32 years.
Well, it's never too late to learn how to do it right.
Here, let me show you.
There is nothing you can show me.
Please be careful with the pancakes.
Don't buy inferior arrow girl cookies.
What are they offering?
Oatmeal.
That's for breakfast.
Mints.
What are you, 60?
And dog poop.
What kind of flavor is that for a cookie?
Oh, my mistake.
That's their peanut butter.
Hello, ladies.
Bobby, what are you doing?
I'm trying to restore the good name of cookies.
Here, taste.
Ew.
This tastes like mud.
What?
That's a lie.
You take that back.
Tasty, Connie.
Don't do it.
Don't let him make you eat mud.
This isn't funny, Bobby.
Connie, wait.
There's nothing wrong with Bobby's cookies.
Look at me.
I'm eating them.
They've got her head all turned around.
Sorry I'm late.
That's what I get for picking the most popular gynecologist in Arlen.
Well, try not to let it happen again.
I can't let the players think I'm giving you special treatment because you're, you know, my wife.
Good afternoon, Lou Ann.
Hi, Uncle Hank.
Run along now.
Hank, Luanne has been my catcher for the last two seasons.
I need her behind the plate.
Enrique is a nice man, but he has got a porcelain hand.
I'm afraid to throw full speed.
Look, the roster's already set, and we already have three women on the team.
Now hear you right.
You said you want to replace our catcher, Enrique, with this little Philly?
Luan has a lot of experience catching me.
But I told her, sir, that we didn't have any room.
Enrique, you're fired!
Better you'll think what they need.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I can stick them somewhere.
Peggy, Peggy, throw it here!
There it is!
Okay, let's walk this next batter set up the double play.
Oh Hank, I can strike out this lap dancer in my sleep.
No, it's not good strategy.
Walk this gal and picture the one with the ridiculous implants up next.
Outfield shift.
No, no, no.
Shift back.
That's right.
A little more.
Say, what?
Are you blind?
He was out by two steps.
Hey, man, get on my face.
You haven't made it right, Cole, since this game started.
This isn't about my wife.
Man, y'all kick your ass.
I'll tell you what.
Get out of here.
Peggy.
Hello, Hank.
So, uh, did we win?
Uh-huh.
How could you get me thrown out of the game?
Me?
What did I have to do with it?
It never would have happened if you didn't shift the fielders back after I moved them.
You embarrassed me as your husband.
I mean coach.
Well, coach, if you had moved them to the right place in the first place... I told you to walk that stripper.
That was a week ago, and I always got to position players in my other league.
Oh, sorry, that's right.
You wouldn't know that because you never came to watch me.
Well, you never watched me sell propane.
Hank, I am sick and tired of always batting last.
It's not fair to me.
You?
You're the one who won't run fast because you're afraid your hat will fall off and your bald spot will show.
Everybody wants to be a superstar today.
Nobody wants to be a team player.
You know, when the coach told Mickey Mantle to take a pitch, and he wasn't too hungover to see the sign, he took the pitch.
I tell you what.
Now, Betty, for the army, will you fontaine de la Tour d'Autrive?
All right, I want you to throw him some chin music.
Get him off the plate so he can't put his gut into it.
You don't know how to position an outfield.
You don't know when to flip a pancake, and you don't know Jack Smith about pitching.
So, back off, Coach!
I'm not asking you as your coach, I'm asking you as your husband.
They're all looking at us.
Well, I am not your wife.
I mean, I am your... Well, on the field, I am... I love you.
Oh yeah!
Damn!
I'm alright!
I'm alright!
Okay, Peggy, I get the message.
Now put it over the plate.
Major point.
I am trying, Hank.
I really am.
Hello, Peggy.
Who is you, Peggy?
There's nothing wrong with you that good coaching can't fix.
Bobby, come on in here, son.
Okay.
Alright, play ball.
I... I... I can't find the plate anymore.
Without my pitching, what am I?
I am just one more four-eyed boggle champion.
Okay, here's your problem.
You need to tuck your elbow in more and release earlier in your windmill.
Really?
Are you sure?
I think I... Don't think.
Thinking leads to overthinking.
Just listen to your coach.
Oh my god!
You killed my men!
Not really.
But you really do suck, Peggy Hill.
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
We're playing Thatherton's team today, Luan.
Be careful.
He'll try every trick in the book to mess with the catcher, including the use of off-color language.
Thatherton!
Luan, while the rest of Arlen was sleeping, I was out in the yard throwing strikes.
And it is safe to say the pitch is back!
Oh, Peggy.
Yeah.
I'll bet you were tucking that elbow in, huh?
Just like I told you.
There we go, Peggy.
Keep tucking that elbow in.
Nah, nah, I don't know that.
We're not gonna take your bait.
I'll take it!
Watch out!
Who's ready to take the cookie challenge?
On the left, Bobby's cookies.
Fresh and buttery.
On the right, Arrowgirl cookies.
Foul and musty.
Bobby Hill, you have mocked your last Arrowgirl cookie.
No!
Hey, what are you doing?
Connie, help!
Save the cookies!
No, we're getting rid of them, my cookies.
Connie, smash them!
Hey, these are great.
They don't taste like mud.
They taste like butter.
Double the butter.
You lied to me.
My boyfriend is a cookie genius.
Yeah, I am a cookie.
Boyfriend?
How you fix for propane, Fatherton?
Double off the pins and feathers and takes the lead!
It's the bottom of the seventh and final inning!
Two outs!
Runner's own first and second and stricklin' up only by a run!
Hey, Hank, your wife seems to have lost her stuff.
Maybe it's the presence of a real man on the field.
No, it is not.
Tuck that elbow, Peggy, square your hips.
Drive off the rubber, concurrent with your release plane.
Concurrent, I said.
The bases are juiced.
Next up, former Texas Ranger, Kurt Bevaqua.
Come out there, I've got a dangin' hunk!
Better than he's got more people on the bases than he does on his payroll!
Oh, shoot!
Your gal's broke, Hank!
She's broke!
Find a way to fix her!
You're her husband!
Husband?
What does that have to do with... Hmm.
I gotta make a change, Peggy.
I'm sorry, I thought I had it worked out.
Debbie, you're playing first base.
And you, you strike this ringer out.
What are you doing, Dad?
I'm making the best coaching decision I ever made.
I'm taking myself out of the game so I can watch your mom pitch.
Hey, man, you don't think they're hugging me up with some of them Ranger tickets, man?
No.
Strike one.
Strike two.
Come on, Peggy, one more time.
You can do it, Mom!
Take him down, Ace!
Oh, yeah!
Oh!
Nyaaah!
Nyaaah!
Nyaaah!
Nyaaah!
All right, you did it, Peggy!
Oh, Hank!
You are the world's greatest coach!
Yeah.
What about that?
Of course, if Dale hadn't made that catch, it would have been a home run.
Oh, please.
We both know that Kurt Mabakua corks his bat.
He always has, and he always will.
Peggy, he was using an aluminum bat.
I didn't say he was smart, Hank.
I said he was a cheater.
They heard man on the place and bang on the ball
