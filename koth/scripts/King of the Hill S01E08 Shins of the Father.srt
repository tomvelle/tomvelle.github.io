1
00:00:12,907 --> 00:00:16,134
Hey, my dad's invitation to the party got returned.

2
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:19,923
Grandpa Cotton Hill Hell USA?

3
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,248
Bobby, why'd you write this?

4
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:24,172
You know your grandpa lives in Houston?

5
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:26,036
Mom says he's the devil.

6
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:28,722
Peggy, how can you tell Bobby that?

7
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:30,444
I said evil Hank.

8
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,247
How you get devil from that is beyond me.

9
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:34,610
I don't want grandpa at my party.

10
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:38,496
The kids are already gonna hate me because you got the wrong kind of bean dip.

11
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:39,678
What's wrong with the bean dip?

12
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:40,939
Wait a minute.

13
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,402
What's wrong with your grandpa?

14
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,244
He's got big plastic teeth.

15
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:45,906
He screams all the time.

16
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:47,689
His legs don't work.

17
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,754
Bobby, never make funny your grandpa's legs.

18
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:55,421
He lost his shins defending Texas in World War II.

19
00:00:56,022 --> 00:01:00,549
Now, son, pick up that phone and invite your granddad to your birthday party.

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,872
Okay.

21
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,280
Hi, Grandpa.

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,208
Bobby, if you're gonna fake dial, you gotta hit more than three numbers.

23
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,400
Woo!

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,892
This thing is a hoof!

25
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,056
Uh, I got a splinter here.

26
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:57,082
Orange, you glad I didn't say banana?

27
00:01:58,204 --> 00:01:59,106
Huh?

28
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,008
Huh?

29
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,591
This party's boring.

30
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,795
Everybody hates you.

31
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,220
Why are you so pissed off for Piggy Hill?

32
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:07,262
Oh, nothing.

33
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:08,103
Just Hank's father.

34
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,586
He's driving in for the party.

35
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,570
Oh, Lord, that crazy Cotton Hill.

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,857
I heard after Hank's mother left Cotton, he married his 16-year-old nurse.

37
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:17,841
Dee Dee is 39, thank you very much.

38
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,185
Although parts of her are much younger.

39
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,088
Ooh, Piggy Hill.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,863
Dad, I'm dying out there.

41
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:29,227
I blew up a balloon with my nose.

42
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:29,988
Nothing.

43
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:31,711
I did this thing.

44
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,055
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,998
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,080
Nothing.

47
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,604
Did you try burping the alphabet?

48
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,068
That's my clothes, Dad.

49
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,402
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

50
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,885
What are you talking about, man?

51
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:48,008
I tell you what, Fat Kid's always funny one, man.

52
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:52,015
There's a thing called John Candy, John Belushi, Knife and Pork, dug their grave, man.

53
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:53,036
Who wants a burger?

54
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:54,839
Well, I'll take that steak.

55
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,141
The hell you say?

56
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,844
Did you win World War II?

57
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,068
This ribeye is for my daddy.

58
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:01,390
Cotton's coming.

59
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,261
Whoa-ho, if I was you, Con, I'd am-scray before he gets here.

60
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,466
Yeah, if he finds out you're from Japan, you know.

61
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:14,294
How many times I tell you, stupid, I'm Le Ocean!

62
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,137
Uh, you?

63
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,400
Uh, Vee?

64
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:27,797
Happy birthday, Bobby!

65
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,783
Oh, Dad, you crazy son of a gun.

66
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:31,910
You really outdid yourself this time.

67
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,054
Well, you know me.

68
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:34,498
I'm larger than life.

69
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,038
Where are its legs?

70
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,561
What are you looking at, Moe?

71
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:45,245
A Japanese machine gun blew my shins off in WW2.

72
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,188
So what?

73
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,871
You like that horse, Bobby?

74
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:50,534
I love it, Grandpa!

75
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:52,938
Well, you can love it for four more hours.

76
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,840
It's a riddle.

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,243
All right, who wants the first ride?

78
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:57,786
Me!

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,241
Hey, Hank's wife.

80
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,984
Well, how long have you been here, Cotton?

81
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:04,706
I didn't notice you... Didi!

82
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,029
Come on out here and gab with Hank's wife.

83
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,431
Look at here, Hank.

84
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:11,736
What do you think of your mama's new tie ties?

85
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,598
Oh, she is not my mother.

86
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:15,421
Hell, we went to kindergarten together.

87
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:16,542
Hey, Hank.

88
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,786
Do you still like finger painting?

89
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,532
Everyone thinks your party's cool, Bobby.

90
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,114
I'm having fun.

91
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,537
Your wife divorced you.

92
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,718
Mr. Kahn, I'll have a Mai Tai.

93
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,301
What do you think?

94
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:39,583
I look for Hank?

95
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:42,309
Dad, this here is my new neighbor.

96
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,112
He's Japanese.

97
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:45,595
No, he ain't.

98
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:48,681
He's Laotian.

99
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:50,785
Thank you, Mr. Kahn.

100
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,376
All right, time to open my gift.

101
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:58,893
Whoa!

102
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:00,615
A super squirter!

103
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:02,778
A two-bar squirter!

104
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,061
There ain't no water at all, Mr. Khan!

105
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:08,626
It's a genuine Winchester 20-gauge shotgun!

106
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,708
You got a real gun!

107
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,811
And now Peggy Hill has a real gun.

108
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,154
Bobby, you are too young to own a firearm, honey.

109
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,656
Did you see that, Hank?

110
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,360
Tell your woman to give him back his gun!

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,101
His woman?

112
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:21,282
Oh, God.

113
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,066
I am my own woman, and don't you forget.

114
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:26,729
Oh, Peg, uh, that's just cowboy talk.

115
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:27,189
Come on.

116
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,992
Hey, let's go bust open that piñata.

117
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:33,176
Kill the boy!

118
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:33,717
Ooh, Bastard!

119
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:34,017
Bastard!

120
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:34,718
Come on, Bobby.

121
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:36,480
Hank, the boy can barely reach it.

122
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,503
Now, lower the piñata so he has a chance at it.

123
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:39,944
Come on.

124
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:43,648
Oh!

125
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:44,790
Crap it!

126
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,631
Feel it!

127
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,513
Ooh, Bastard!

128
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:47,693
Bastard!

129
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,309
Kill it, boy!

130
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,835
It must be made of kryptonite or something.

131
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,417
We're crying out loud!

132
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,299
Oh, good Lord Cotton!

133
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,162
You gave him a loaded shotgun?

134
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,525
Well, you don't give a toile without batteries.

135
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,890
Come and get your Tootsie Rolls!

136
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:15,255
Oh, I'm so sorry your grandpa ruined your birthday, son.

137
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,237
He didn't ruin it.

138
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,378
He made it fine.

139
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,262
Bobby, come on over here, boy.

140
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,193
Take off them pink love.

141
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,697
That's women's work.

142
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:25,799
Leave him alone.

143
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,102
He's a good helper.

144
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,428
Oh, whatever you say, Hillary.

145
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,799
Cotton, I'll do the dishes.

146
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,082
I like to.

147
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,466
Permission granted.

148
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,533
Put an apron over your new bosom, too.

149
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,456
Don't tell her, but I got them cheap.

150
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,497
Both lefties!

151
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,600
So, Bobby, what's it gonna do with your life?

152
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,822
I'm gonna be a prop comic.

153
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:51,266
I'm working on this bit where I stick a green bean up my nose.

154
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,047
Well, now that sounds promising.

155
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:58,413
Hank, Bobby and me have decided he's gonna stick vegetables up his nose.

156
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,675
He's not gonna take over the family gas station.

157
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,117
Dad, I don't work at a gas station.

158
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,639
I sell propane and propane accessories.

159
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,680
Don't sass me, boy!

160
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,503
You ain't too big for me to give you a licking!

161
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:12,588
Oh, dad, you old skunk.

162
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,650
Come on, grease monkey.

163
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:14,692
Let's tangle.

164
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,836
All right, Kyle.

165
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,338
Now, you are breaking my good dishes.

166
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,681
It's time for you to leave.

167
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:21,343
Come on.

168
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:21,924
Come on.

169
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:25,190
I will fix you a to-go plate.

170
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,452
Don't worry about the horse.

171
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:28,656
If it comes back, we'll call the rental place.

172
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,356
Damn, won't start.

173
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,258
I guess I'm not going anywhere.

174
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:36,379
Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,280
Just pop the hood.

176
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,661
Hank can fix it in a minute.

177
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,382
Don't bother, Uncle Hank.

178
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,464
I can't hear the solenoid plunger.

179
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,066
You're going to need a new one.

180
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:45,427
Thanks a lot, girly.

181
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,929
But the truth is, you're a girl.

182
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,873
Hank, we'll have to wait till your gas station opens up in the morning.

183
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:52,873
I guess I'm staying over.

184
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,576
I wish you could, but we are all out of beds.

185
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,356
I don't need a bed.

186
00:07:57,498 --> 00:08:01,461
I can sleep in a drawer after what they did to me overseas.

187
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,564
I could sleep on the couch, Mom.

188
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,846
Well, that'll be just fine.

189
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,749
Excuse me for just a second.

190
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,255
I do not want that ill-mannered foul mouth old man to spend another moment in my house.

191
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,558
Oh, you just don't understand him, Peg.

192
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,583
See, he's a big flamboyant character like a peacock.

193
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:19,146
That's why men love him.

194
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:23,471
But women don't like his style because you all are like the pee hen.

195
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:26,115
More subdued and drab.

196
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:30,068
You just cannot see your father for who he is.

197
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,372
Well, Bobby and I both want him to stay.

198
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:34,356
So that means you're out voted.

199
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:34,937
Oh, yeah?

200
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,459
Well, Luann hates him, too.

201
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,862
That means we're even.

202
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:40,666
Well, Jesus loves him, so I win.

203
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,453
Well, what does that have to do with... Hey, Dad, we'd love it if you stayed.

204
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:45,695
Well, all righty.

205
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:50,804
Bitty, we're bunking here tonight.

206
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,727
Mr. Khan, my bag!

207
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,503
What do you say I drive you to school today, Bobby?

208
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,789
Hey, you fix my car yet?

209
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,213
I just woke up.

210
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:04,315
Just what?

211
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,519
It's 7 a.m.

212
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,727
If you were in the army, you could have dug 10 graves by now.

213
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:10,632
I hope you're all hungry.

214
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,470
Good looking breakfast, Peg.

215
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,333
Yeah, I see bacon.

216
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:15,755
I see ham.

217
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,257
I see steak.

218
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:18,919
Sausage!

219
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:19,860
Where's my sausage?

220
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,342
There's no sausage!

221
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:27,571
Well, Cotton, you are welcome to march yourself down to the safeway, but I have to get ready for work.

222
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:29,113
See you, Bobby.

223
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:30,255
Woman works.

224
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,157
Man loses his sausage.

225
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:39,167
You know, Cotton, I'd love to debate this with you, but I am just a little too busy living here in the latter half of the 20th century.

226
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:43,037
Hey dad, if you want to drive Bobby to school, use my truck.

227
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,279
I'll go rig up your pedal extenders.

228
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,903
You're all skin and bones, girly.

229
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,626
Put some cornpone on them hips.

230
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,488
I don't want any grandpa hell.

231
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:54,810
Don't want to get fat.

232
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,572
That's not for you to worry about.

233
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,174
You will never know if you are attractive.

234
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,117
It's up to a man to tell you that.

235
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:04,260
You keep eating, and I'll tell you when to stop.

236
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,489
Touch me again and go be wearing that cornpone, old man.

237
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,690
Really?

238
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:09,832
Feisty!

239
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:17,041
You sure it's okay for me to be out of school today, Grandpa?

240
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,123
Well, yeah, it's a holiday, isn't it?

241
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,346
It's Angie Dickinson's birthday.

242
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:24,430
Now, why don't you order us some food?

243
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:24,790
Really?

244
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,434
Dad never lets me order.

245
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,955
Yeah, well, you went with your daddy today.

246
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:30,197
Go to it.

247
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:34,121
Excuse me, ma'am.

248
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:35,763
Uh, ma'am.

249
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:35,963
Oh, good.

250
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:36,104
Sweet.

251
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:36,945
You'll never get no service that way.

252
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:38,948
You gotta get her in the moneymaker.

253
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:39,188
Hey, Missy.

254
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:39,809
How about some sandwiches?

255
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:51,325
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

256
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,032
Well, that's the dangedest thing.

257
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:57,416
I never heard of a solenoid just disappearing before.

258
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:58,518
I don't know.

259
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:02,182
Sometimes things just disappear for no logical reason.

260
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:05,827
One day my cousin woke up, his kidney was gone.

261
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:13,457
At the same time, five hundred miles away, a woman in Phoenix contracted diabetes.

262
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,760
I fixed it, Uncle Hank.

263
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,072
Oh, he purrs.

264
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,455
He's like, dang, old kid.

265
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,720
Yep, my dad sure knows how to take care of his cars.

266
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:34,875
When I was a baby, he had my mama make me a shammy jumpsuit, and I used to crawl around on the hood and buff it till it shined like Christmas.

267
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,038
Your dad, I swear.

268
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:41,065
How about when he took us down to the hotel, Arlen?

269
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:41,986
Oh, yeah.

270
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,148
Remember that, Hank?

271
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:50,788
Hank, you won the big game.

272
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:54,412
So, I'm buying you and your friends hookers.

273
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,735
Now come on, boys, pickers out that'll have one.

274
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:58,877
Hey there, Mr. Quarterback.

275
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,165
Not every dad would do something like that to his son.

276
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:06,987
I mean, for his son.

277
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,133
What, how's it coming with the car, grease monkey?

278
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:14,215
That's real funny, Peg.

279
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,294
Look what I found.

280
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,858
Wait, that's a solenoid.

281
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:18,759
Where'd you find that?

282
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,526
In Cotton's room, wrapped in his little bitty pants under a big pile of lies.

283
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:26,651
Damn it, I killed a whole day fixing that car.

284
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:27,993
I don't understand.

285
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,735
Oh, Hank, what is to understand?

286
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:35,063
Your father disfigured his own automobile just so he could stay here and drive me crazy.

287
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:38,568
Oh, Peggy, the poor guy just wants to spend time with us.

288
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:42,193
And you've made it so hard for him, he's afraid to ask.

289
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:42,734
You're right.

290
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:43,794
It's my fault.

291
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,917
Why didn't I serve that poor man his sausage?

292
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,459
What's the point in arguing?

293
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,200
The car is fixed now.

294
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,641
He'll be out of here tonight.

295
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,485
Aunt Peg, I found this timing belt in the laundry.

296
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,347
You want me to wash it with the darks?

297
00:12:58,668 --> 00:12:59,809
Good morning, angels.

298
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,351
Do I have an assignment for you?

299
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:03,892
Good morning, Charlie.

300
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,774
Ah, damn!

301
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,176
It's a Shelley hack!

302
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,138
That's like getting a shimp.

303
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,205
What in the hell is going on here?

304
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,229
Where are your pants?

305
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:15,111
We were hot.

306
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:15,712
Take them off.

307
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:19,378
A man doesn't have to wear pants around the house if he doesn't want to.

308
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,682
Yeah, what you got them blue jeans on for, Hank?

309
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:22,604
Let's go.

310
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:23,345
Take them off.

311
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:24,908
I don't want to take them off.

312
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,673
Buddy, take your daddy's pants off.

313
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:29,717
Okie dokie cotton, Hank.

314
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:30,398
Fix your car.

315
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,703
I guess you'll be wanting to head back right about now.

316
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:33,544
Peggy.

317
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,078
Well, um, maybe we should think about getting back.

318
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:38,859
Huh, honey?

319
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,700
What did you say?

320
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:41,343
What did you say?

321
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:41,423
OK.

322
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,012
Now, what did you say, baby kinks?

323
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,273
We can leave.

324
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,497
Hank fixed the car.

325
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:52,340
Actually, Luann fixed it.

326
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:57,688
Oh, that's a good one, Hank's wife.

327
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,831
A woman fixing a car.

328
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,535
That's like a pig trying to read.

329
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:03,892
Yeah.

330
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:08,020
Well, I guess you can go home now, Dad.

331
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,385
Now, I don't think so.

332
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,429
We're gonna stick around a few more days.

333
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,172
Supper time, Colonel.

334
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,060
You've forgotten my beer!

335
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:20,524
Come on, get me my beer, woman.

336
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:24,228
Mom, I'll take my dinner in here, too.

337
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,289
Bobby, you will not.

338
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,091
We eat our dinner in the kitchen.

339
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,873
Boy wants his dinner in here.

340
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,215
Well, we eat in the kitchen.

341
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:31,756
Here.

342
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,356
Kitchen.

343
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:32,757
Here.

344
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:33,257
Kitchen.

345
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:33,618
Here.

346
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,800
I forgot, psych, I need a little support here.

347
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:44,269
Well, Peggy, it might be nice for a change to have dinner in front of the TV.

348
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:47,592
Well, go on, woman, get me my dinner.

349
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,103
I don't know where you got the idea.

350
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:53,945
You could slap your mother's behind.

351
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,810
I'll tell you where he got the idea.

352
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,012
Your father.

353
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:00,776
And it's all your fault for not nipping it in the bud.

354
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:01,937
What do you want me to do?

355
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,340
I can't change my father.

356
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,583
Well, he certainly won't listen to me now, will he?

357
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,105
You're both men.

358
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,068
You're both peacocks, remember?

359
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,612
What are you turning into some kind of feminist?

360
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:14,136
I am not a feminist, Hank.

361
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:17,821
I am Peggy Hill, a citizen of the Republic of Texas.

362
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:23,710
I work hard, I sweat hard, and I love hard, and I gotta smell good and look pretty while I'm doing it.

363
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:31,141
So I comb my hair, I reapply lipstick 30 times a day, I do your dishes, I wash your clothes, and I clean the house.

364
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:38,492
Not because I have to, Hank, but because of a mutual unspoken agreement that I have never brought up because I am too much of a lady.

365
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,136
30 times a day?

366
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:43,646
Yeah, I'm kind of like it here.

367
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,993
What kind of work can that guy get in this town?

368
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:49,183
Uh, are you allergic to asbestos?

369
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,026
Hello?

370
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,089
Hey, Dad.

371
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,657
Hey, if it ain't the ol' grease monkey!

372
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:54,725
All right, Dad.

373
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:58,572
I need to talk to you about some of the things you've been telling Bobby.

374
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:00,536
I've been telling Bobby a lot of things.

375
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:04,684
For example, I told him how I lost my shins defending our country.

376
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:06,166
You want to hear that story, Fatty?

377
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:07,268
Sure, yes, sir!

378
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,073
Bill, I'm trying to talk to my... I was 14.

379
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:11,997
Just a little older than Bobby.

380
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,341
But I knew Uncle Sam needed me.

381
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:17,046
So I lied and signed up.

382
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,349
And we had beaten the Nazis in Italy.

383
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,693
And they shipped us to the Pacific Theater.

384
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,979
A Tojo torpedo sent our troops ship to the bottom.

385
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,683
I could only save three of my buddies.

386
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:32,166
Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn.

387
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:35,271
They were kind of like you fellas, only one of them was from Brooklyn.

388
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:40,418
Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero and put fifty bullets in my bow.

389
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,261
The blood attracted sharks.

390
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:46,307
I had to give them Fatty.

391
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,442
Then things took a turn for the worse.

392
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:49,824
I met it to an island.

393
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,968
But it was full of tojos.

394
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,391
They were spittin' on the US flag.

395
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,913
So I rushed them.

396
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,215
But it was a trap.

397
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:02,601
They opened fire and blew my skin off.

398
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:07,627
Last thing I remember, I beat them all to death with a big piece of fattie.

399
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:12,674
I woke up in a field hospital, and they were sewing my feet to my knees.

400
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:14,877
Now,

401
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,210
What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Hank?

402
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,094
Well, nothing, I guess.

403
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:31,622
You've had enough cake, Connie.

404
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:32,984
What are you doing?

405
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:36,327
A man's gotta tell a woman when to stop eating.

406
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,309
You're looking kind of chunky.

407
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,811
Oh, she's moody.

408
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,653
Must be PBS.

409
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:46,115
Let's go.

410
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,336
I gotta see a man about a horse.

411
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,059
Bobby, don't forget to bust your tray.

412
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,861
Ah, that's women's work.

413
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,002
Ain't that right, fellas?

414
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:56,924
Women's work!

415
00:17:57,684 --> 00:17:58,645
Women's work!

416
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,447
Women's work!

417
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,448
Women's work!

418
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:02,929
Women's work!

419
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:05,551
Women's work!

420
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:05,831
Women's work!

421
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,111
Women's work!

422
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:06,392
Women's work!

423
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:06,672
Women's work!

424
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:06,972
Women's work!

425
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:12,577
Well, she's got a point, but he's a war hero.

426
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,019
She's my wife.

427
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:17,290
But he's got no shins.

428
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,235
Uh, I'm just trying to get a little propane here.

429
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:24,658
Stricklin' propane.

430
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:27,982
Bobby was sent home from school for starting a sexist riot today.

431
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:28,663
What?

432
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:30,805
I'm coming home right now.

433
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:35,671
Well, you're just a little too late, because the devil took Bobby off to the Hotel Arlen.

434
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:36,872
Hotel Arlen!

435
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,601
Bobby!

436
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,613
I'm proud of you for what you did at school today.

437
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,036
So I'm buying you a hooker.

438
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,278
Go ahead, pick yourself out alive way.

439
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:54,201
Alive one what?

440
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,084
Hey, cutie, you got papers?

441
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,652
Bobby, get over here now.

442
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,776
Grandpa said I could- Bobby, you heard your mother.

443
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:07,557
Get over there.

444
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:09,699
What are you saying, Hank?

445
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,922
Are you siding with your woman?

446
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,689
Look at me, son!

447
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,591
Look at my shins!

448
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:21,437
Look, Dad, I'm sorry about fatty and your shins, but I'm not a kid anymore.

449
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:27,063
Bobby is my boy, and I won't let him grow up to be a woman hating old fool.

450
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,865
No wonder Mom left you.

451
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:32,729
She was a strong lady, classy and smart like Peg.

452
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,171
Maybe you couldn't handle that, but I can.

453
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:38,635
My marriage is a partnership of equals.

454
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:47,667
Peggy might do all the housework, but there are a lot of other things that I'm supposed to do, but I'm not going to say what they are because I'm a gentleman.

455
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,268
Oh, I get it.

456
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:50,171
She's making you say this.

457
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,953
You're just her puppet.

458
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,697
No, Dad, I'm saying all this because I mean it.

459
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,459
Now, Dee Dee's out in the car.

460
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:57,440
I had her pack up.

461
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,002
It's time for you to head home.

462
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:06,833
Well, I never thought I'd see the day when my own son would stop loving me.

463
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,378
It's about time!

464
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,420
Love for sissies!

465
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:23,167
Ain't that right, ya house full of hookers?

466
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,829
All right, hookers, listen up.

467
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,214
I'll be back next year so don't be jacking up your prices.

468
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,618
I'll be staying over to Hank Hill's home.

469
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,906
Bobby, you gotta try and forget all that gobbledygook your grandpa told ya.

470
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:40,549
You listen to your mother, she knows best.

471
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:41,725
But she's a woman.

472
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,608
How could she know better than Grandpa?

473
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:51,518
Well, because she's a lot smarter than him for one, your mother's probably got a better head on her shoulders than anybody in Ireland.

474
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:54,723
Better than Bill, or Dale, or Boomerower?

475
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:58,528
Geez, Bobby, why not compare it to a baboon in the zoo?

476
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:00,951
But I thought they were your best friends.

477
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,874
Peggy's my best friend, son.

478
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:03,955
Mom?

479
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:04,856
That's right.

480
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:09,641
And when you're older, I hope you're lucky enough to find a girl to be best friends with, too.

481
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:11,823
You think that'll really happen to me?

482
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:15,747
Well, it won't if you keep slapping them in the butt and ordering them around.

483
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:16,968
You'll do okay.

484
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:18,770
You just have to remember one thing.

485
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:22,514
Women were not put on this earth to serve you and me.

486
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,437
Now, what do you say we get an ice cream?
