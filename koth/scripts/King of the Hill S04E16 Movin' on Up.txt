Boy, look at Pops go.
80 years old and he still has the reaction time to Mr. Sprinkler heads.
Tony Curtis is 80.
Look at him.
Now he's just showboating.
Come on, Pops.
Let's see those hands at 10 and 2.
Uh, Pops?
Mr. Pops is 80.
No, man, it ain't manning.
Boy, I tell you, it's sad, but at least he went doing what he loved.
Well, we should all be still lucky.
You know how I want to go right here in Nile with you guys?
It'll probably be my heart the way things are going.
We should rent that house ourselves.
We could turn it into a clubhouse.
I am currently an official supporter of the clubhouse idea.
I also reserve the right to be called Dash.
And I'll be spiked.
A clubhouse?
I don't know.
Isn't that something you do when you're in your thirties?
No, man.
Come on, Hank.
You know, getting on with the DVD player, man.
They're gonna come in and I'll show you.
Just grab it on there, and they'll come and freeze-frame it on you.
Don't mind the old fridge full of beer, too, man.
Well, boom, Howard, I tell you, you ought to be in sales.
All right, I'm in.
Welcome to the clubhouse, Hank.
What do you want to be called?
How about Rudy?
How about Hank?
Hank, it is.
Rudy.
You are so late.
You know I like my bath at 9.30 with my onion loaf.
I'm sorry.
The cash registered in balance and it took Gary 20 minutes to confess.
Do you mind if I just take a quick shower first?
I smell like waitressing.
I'm sorry.
My bath is already gone.
Okay.
I'm taking off my boxers.
What the?
Bah, Luanne!
Oh my god, I thought you guys were sleeping.
But you guys weren't sleeping!
Exit the master bedroom right now!
Boxers... Luanne, we have rules in this house.
Why are you guys getting so upset?
I didn't see anything.
You saw your uncle's nipples.
The way I see it, you are in direct violation of four of our rules.
You had it notarized?
No water usage after 10 p.m., 9 p.m.
curfew on school nights, entering the master bedroom without verbal permission, and your barefoot in the kitchen.
Lady Bird eats off that floor.
God only has 10 rules, Uncle Hank, and his house is much bigger.
All right, Dale, for the last time, I can't turn in this rental application without your social security number.
Fine.
Five, five, five.
Five, five.
That's not even enough numbers.
Five.
Okay, I'm leaving your name off, but you're still responsible for one-fourth of the rent.
I figure I can pull my extra workbench out of public storage and keep it in the clubhouse.
That'll save me a few bucks a month, and I've given it some thought and I've decided to start charging Luann some rent for living in my den.
See a house right across from me!
They want to use our clubhouse as their living quarters.
Hank, we have to do something.
I don't know, Con.
The house looks nice, but the neighborhood looks a little hillbilly to me.
Hillbilly?
I have an idea.
Follow my lead.
Hey, Mr. Con, them some fancy blue jeans y'all's lady friend is wearing.
They must be city folk.
I just hooked up a new batch of possum stew I'd be willing to share with you.
The way I took off the feet.
What did he just say?
All great chefs doing that now.
Wolfgang Puck cut the feet off of everything.
Thank God I'm a country boy.
They just stay laborers.
They're putting in my deck.
Our plan worked.
Spike, Rudy, Boomhower, let's check out our new clubhouse.
Yeah, man, you're talking about everybody out there that ain't gonna dick nank except me, man.
I know that'll look damn wild man up, man.
All right, Boomhower, what do you want to be called?
You know, beat dog.
Saw figure if we knock down that wall and build a new wall over there, that'd be fun.
Hey, refrigerator!
Look!
Pops last beer.
Huh.
Huh.
Two pops.
That son of a bitch had a swimming pool.
I thought I heard splashing.
How could you not know you lived next door to him for 18 years?
I thought he lived on a lake.
What lake?
It was none of my business.
So, you're the ones who broke my lock box.
Uh, was the open house canceled?
I'm sorry, this house has already been rented to a lovely college student.
College student?
No college student's gonna have a credit history like mine.
Here are your keys, Miss Platter.
Welcome home.
Luanne?
Young lady, you better march right back into Hank's den.
That's your home and that will always be your home, right, Hank?
Luanne, welcome to your new home.
I'm not gonna be stingy with the packing tape, Luanne.
You tape away.
It's not that I want to move.
It's just that I hate living here.
There's just too many rules.
Yep.
Way too many rules.
Goodbye.
And if I have to pay rent, I'm not gonna sleep in a den and share a bathtub with a 12-year-old boy, okay?
Rent?
Excuse me.
Hank, did you pass a new law while this hill was not in session?
Just tied up a rental loophole.
The important thing is she's happy.
And I'm not paying for it all alone.
See, this friend of mine who got kicked out of her apartment, she had three roommates who also got kicked out of the apartment, and she said I could have them.
I don't know.
I just think that I should move out before we end up hating each other.
Oh, Luann, we could never hate you.
He's making a good point, Puggy.
We lost everything so fast, and Hank did nothing to stop it.
Like the Swiss.
How did you precious Dan?
Visual confirmation.
Room mate number one.
Female.
Dang the jar head, huh?
My first choice was the Marines, but I couldn't do enough sit-ups to be a Marine Corps barber.
Tempur pie.
Oh, great.
We've got a disco dancer.
Anyone can move slow.
Hey, guys drinking beer?
You're in my parking spot.
No, I don't think so.
This is where we assemble.
Always has been.
Well, always has been Texas Penal Code 49.02, which prohibits public drunkenness.
What are you talking about?
Nobody's drunk here.
No, I don't know, Hank.
I'm pretty buzzed.
My lease says this is my space.
No!
Hey!
thought so.
Gentlemen, I give you roomate number three.
I kind of like her.
Well,
Now you've got a lawsuit.
The Audacity!
I have unplugged your house from my house.
Hmm, that's not very neighborly of you.
You know, when it hits 105 degrees and you want to use my pool and drink my soy shakes, I'm gonna remember this.
Yeah, well, there goes your welcome wagon tool set.
You happy?
So, who'd like to meet my other roommates?
The manger babies!
This is the original feather ball from the third and... Oh, I know what you're thinking.
I perform a Christian puppet show.
Okay, we need to go to the grocery store.
I already went to the store and Sir Reginald noticed how expensive food is these days.
There's food?
They're not gonna leave you a scrap.
What, what?
One in the garage, one in the den.
What you doing?
Oh, nothing.
Just, uh, working on my den.
I always wanted a clubhouse with a secret knock.
How about, uh...
No, that's a secret knock at the gun club.
I don't want to get confused.
How about this?
You know, part of the reason I agreed to the clubhouse idea was that one of the bedrooms over there was going to be my private den.
And, well, now that I've got my den... Our clubhouse?
My den.
Yep, that's the official knock.
It'll hold us until I can get a retina scanner.
Hey guys, I figured out all the bills.
I used additions and subtractions.
Ooh, wow, I'm gonna have to catch up with you later.
See, I have a bike race coming up and there's gonna be this chick there that I dig, so I need to get a new shirt that really sports my abs.
I mean, check it out.
Yeah, I can't pay this right now either.
I'm going to Vegas this weekend.
Um, okay.
Okay?
The phone bill is pretty much 100% yours.
So anyway, my little sister, she borrowed my Kangal hat.
Yes, I'm mad!
Listen, when I signed up for a phone service, I signed a document that said I would pay on time.
I swore it!
And my mother's maiden name!
You're kinda being a house Nazi right now, Luan.
Hello, I thought we agreed no smoking in the house.
You know who else had anti-smoking laws?
Uh, who was it?
Oh yeah, HITLER!
Nazi!
Louan!
What's up, girlfriend?
I have not seen you in the longest.
Oh, okay.
You guys are finished with dinner already.
Why?
Are you hungry?
Louan, are you eating?
Do you need money?
Get my purse.
No, no, no, no, no!
At Peggy, no!
I'm on my own now, and I don't need help from anyone.
Oh.
But I am doing a book report on what people eat for dinner.
So... what do you eat?
Let me fix you a to-go plate.
Hey, Luan.
What you got there?
Nothing.
This isn't mine.
It's nice to see Luan once in a while.
Knowing she'll be leaving kind of makes it like a fun game.
There is nothing funny about starvation.
Except for comic relief, of course.
Now Luan is very proud and may not accept our charity, but she's also very hungry.
So who knows?
Luan is usually home from work by now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys can shave their legs too?
That's very interesting!
Peggy!
Bobby!
Sorry, Dad.
Heads up, their fur is home from work.
Whose turn is it to take the trash out?
Don't make me get out the tour wheel.
Oh, Uncle Hank and Peggy, you're here.
We brought a casserole for dinner.
No, no, no, no, no.
I won't hear of it.
I'm on my own now, and I can make you dinner.
Dinner.
I'm on it.
Oh, crap.
Dinner.
Ah, there are crackers.
Where is my macaroni and the cheese?
Where are my stickers?
That is it!
Who ate all my food?
Come forward!
I needed a carbo load.
Riffin, are you?
We said no shaving in the living room unless it was an emergency.
When I think of how many stupid onion loves I had to sell so your people can talk on the phone and eat my cookies, it makes me so...
Maybe we should intervene.
You go talk to the German one.
We have rules in this house.
We all agree to them, PayPal.
I'm counting at least 12 violations.
Oh, my God.
I have become you.
I hate myself.
I'm worried about Lou Ann.
She hates herself because she's become Bobby?
I mean, what's that all about?
Hank, she was pointing at you.
She's become you.
And that is why she hates herself.
Oh, well, then she's just crazy.
Hank, please talk to her.
I can hear her crying in her room.
Her room?
My den.
And for all we know, she could be laughing.
All right.
It is very sad to see people take advantage of the kindness of others.
Yes, it is.
Alright.
Bill, Dale, Boomhauer, get out.
Come on.
Spike, Dash, Bee Dog.
You know, back in your house when you said, I've become you,
Well, you said it like, I've become you.
When, well, you probably could have said it more like,
Hey, I've become you.
What?
You see, Luan, a lot of good stuff happened in the world when people were like me.
Sure, they'll never write a Hollywood musical about a fella who keeps his yard free of debris and pays his bills on time, and the MTV won't put on a video about a man who requires shoes in the kitchen, but it's because of people like us.
I'm not like you.
This is just too much for me.
And all the bills and they mooch my food and they're always on the phone.
And I just can't take it anymore.
I can't stand one more day.
They're wearing my socks.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, I need a paper bag.
Now, take it easy.
You didn't see me getting all huffy every time you made me mad.
I'll make you mad.
Sure.
And you were three times the pain in the butt these kids are.
Ah, good.
Then you'll be able to handle them for me.
Maybe I could, but I don't want to give you a fish, Luan.
I want to teach you how to fish.
That way you'll eat forever.
Hello, I'm with the electric company.
Don't mind me, I'll only be a minute.
I'm on break.
Please continue with your private conversation.
Do not worry.
I am deaf and cannot hear what you are saying.
You know, Luan, you and I both wanted a little place of our own.
I thought my den would be my oasis, but now the only place I can get away from the various annoyances in my life is... Is?
is my lawn.
When I'm out there mowing, edging, watering, even fertilizing, nothing else matters.
Yep, that's what you gotta do, Luann.
Find yourself a project.
Find your own lawn.
That's it?
I couldn't help but overhear your uncle's bad advice.
What?
Aha!
It is I, Dale Grebel, master of a thousand faces.
You just met face number two.
The death electrician.
The only thing your roommates, i.e.
enemies, will understand is fear, i.e.
psychological warfare, i.e.
dirty tricks.
They work for Dick Nixon.
For example, get ahold of some goat's blood.
Taint that blood.
Then when your roommates need blood, give them the tainted goat's blood.
It's a perfect plan.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just want them to do the dishes.
Oh.
Well, in that case, stack the dishes in the shower.
That's the way Nancy gets me to do them.
Luan, do you mind?
What are you doing?
Well, somebody left a bunch of dishes in the shower.
That's kind of rude.
Good Lord, I hate these people.
I know, Jesus.
I know.
You told me never to say hate.
But I'm sorry, Lord.
I really, really do.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
Hey, Uncle Hyde.
Guess what?
Right this second.
The pH balance in this pool is absolutely perfect.
So you found yourself a project.
Do you get the same high I get from lawn care?
You know, I think I do.
Excuse me.
You didn't pay your bills, did you?
Oh well, Luan, at least you tried.
Oh, I paid my bills.
And then I closed all the accounts.
If my roommates want gas, water, electricity, or a phone, they can just open up their own accounts.
Simple as that.
You know, if you're ever up late studying for a test and you want a little electricity, I've still got that extension cord.
No thanks, Uncle Hank.
You taught me how to fish.
Yep.
Yep.
Let this place look terrible!
You ain't pups!
Oh, that old guy, yeah, he died.
Dead?
Then I'm arresting you for suspicion and murder!
Grab him, Topsy!
No, I'm alright, boy.
It's comin' out.
Hey, get your hands off me, you Nazi!
Who are you callin' a nazi?!
No!
Alright, Topsy!
Let's roll!
Truth or dare?
Dare!
