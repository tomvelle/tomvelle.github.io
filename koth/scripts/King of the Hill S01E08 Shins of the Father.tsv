12907	16134	Hey, my dad's invitation to the party got returned.
16595	19923	Grandpa Cotton Hill Hell USA?
20564	22248	Bobby, why'd you write this?
22308	24172	You know your grandpa lives in Houston?
24553	26036	Mom says he's the devil.
26297	28722	Peggy, how can you tell Bobby that?
28702	30444	I said evil Hank.
30465	32247	How you get devil from that is beyond me.
32808	34610	I don't want grandpa at my party.
34871	38496	The kids are already gonna hate me because you got the wrong kind of bean dip.
38516	39678	What's wrong with the bean dip?
40299	40939	Wait a minute.
40959	42402	What's wrong with your grandpa?
42522	44244	He's got big plastic teeth.
44525	45906	He screams all the time.
46187	47689	His legs don't work.
47669	50754	Bobby, never make funny your grandpa's legs.
51255	55421	He lost his shins defending Texas in World War II.
56022	60549	Now, son, pick up that phone and invite your granddad to your birthday party.
61130	61872	Okay.
65197	67280	Hi, Grandpa.
67300	72208	Bobby, if you're gonna fake dial, you gotta hit more than three numbers.
102935	105400	Woo!
105420	111892	This thing is a hoof!
111912	114056	Uh, I got a splinter here.
114417	117082	Orange, you glad I didn't say banana?
118204	119106	Huh?
119126	120008	Huh?
120028	121591	This party's boring.
122192	123795	Everybody hates you.
124417	126220	Why are you so pissed off for Piggy Hill?
126641	127262	Oh, nothing.
127282	128103	Just Hank's father.
128264	129586	He's driving in for the party.
129887	131570	Oh, Lord, that crazy Cotton Hill.
131850	135857	I heard after Hank's mother left Cotton, he married his 16-year-old nurse.
136077	137841	Dee Dee is 39, thank you very much.
138622	140185	Although parts of her are much younger.
140225	142088	Ooh, Piggy Hill.
144920	146863	Dad, I'm dying out there.
147224	149227	I blew up a balloon with my nose.
149568	149988	Nothing.
150509	151711	I did this thing.
152492	154055	What are you talking about?
154456	155998	What are you talking about?
156539	157080	Nothing.
157521	159604	Did you try burping the alphabet?
159985	162068	That's my clothes, Dad.
162419	164402	Hey, man, what are you talking about?
164422	165885	What are you talking about, man?
165905	168008	I tell you what, Fat Kid's always funny one, man.
168028	172015	There's a thing called John Candy, John Belushi, Knife and Pork, dug their grave, man.
172035	173036	Who wants a burger?
173657	174839	Well, I'll take that steak.
175120	176141	The hell you say?
176182	177844	Did you win World War II?
178405	180068	This ribeye is for my daddy.
180288	181390	Cotton's coming.
182315	186261	Whoa-ho, if I was you, Con, I'd am-scray before he gets here.
186341	189466	Yeah, if he finds out you're from Japan, you know.
189807	194294	How many times I tell you, stupid, I'm Le Ocean!
194314	196137	Uh, you?
196157	198400	Uh, Vee?
204607	207797	Happy birthday, Bobby!
207817	209783	Oh, Dad, you crazy son of a gun.
209964	211910	You really outdid yourself this time.
212171	213054	Well, you know me.
213174	214498	I'm larger than life.
219035	221038	Where are its legs?
221058	222561	What are you looking at, Moe?
222581	225245	A Japanese machine gun blew my shins off in WW2.
226587	227188	So what?
227890	228871	You like that horse, Bobby?
229172	230534	I love it, Grandpa!
230774	232938	Well, you can love it for four more hours.
233319	233840	It's a riddle.
234440	236243	All right, who wants the first ride?
237726	237786	Me!
240280	241241	Hey, Hank's wife.
241562	242984	Well, how long have you been here, Cotton?
243605	244706	I didn't notice you... Didi!
245187	247029	Come on out here and gab with Hank's wife.
247630	248431	Look at here, Hank.
248912	251736	What do you think of your mama's new tie ties?
251756	253598	Oh, she is not my mother.
253698	255421	Hell, we went to kindergarten together.
256021	256542	Hey, Hank.
257563	259786	Do you still like finger painting?
261008	263532	Everyone thinks your party's cool, Bobby.
264052	265114	I'm having fun.
265975	267537	Your wife divorced you.
274233	276718	Mr. Kahn, I'll have a Mai Tai.
277119	278301	What do you think?
278782	279583	I look for Hank?
280465	282309	Dad, this here is my new neighbor.
282890	284112	He's Japanese.
284573	285595	No, he ain't.
287819	288681	He's Laotian.
289362	290785	Thank you, Mr. Kahn.
293671	296376	All right, time to open my gift.
298432	298893	Whoa!
299193	300615	A super squirter!
301056	302778	A two-bar squirter!
302918	305061	There ain't no water at all, Mr. Khan!
305501	308626	It's a genuine Winchester 20-gauge shotgun!
308886	310708	You got a real gun!
311189	312811	And now Peggy Hill has a real gun.
313192	315154	Bobby, you are too young to own a firearm, honey.
315595	316656	Did you see that, Hank?
316997	319360	Tell your woman to give him back his gun!
319340	320101	His woman?
320822	321282	Oh, God.
322043	324066	I am my own woman, and don't you forget.
324086	326729	Oh, Peg, uh, that's just cowboy talk.
326769	327189	Come on.
327830	329992	Hey, let's go bust open that piñata.
330513	333176	Kill the boy!
333196	333717	Ooh, Bastard!
333737	334017	Bastard!
334037	334718	Come on, Bobby.
334738	336480	Hank, the boy can barely reach it.
336520	339503	Now, lower the piñata so he has a chance at it.
339524	339944	Come on.
343488	343648	Oh!
343849	344790	Crap it!
344810	345631	Feel it!
345651	347513	Ooh, Bastard!
347533	347693	Bastard!
353967	355309	Kill it, boy!
355789	359835	It must be made of kryptonite or something.
359855	361417	We're crying out loud!
362278	363299	Oh, good Lord Cotton!
363540	365162	You gave him a loaded shotgun?
365462	367525	Well, you don't give a toile without batteries.
368827	370890	Come and get your Tootsie Rolls!
371651	375255	Oh, I'm so sorry your grandpa ruined your birthday, son.
375275	376237	He didn't ruin it.
376397	377378	He made it fine.
377939	380262	Bobby, come on over here, boy.
382030	383193	Take off them pink love.
383694	384697	That's women's work.
384957	385799	Leave him alone.
386180	387102	He's a good helper.
387503	389428	Oh, whatever you say, Hillary.
392155	393799	Cotton, I'll do the dishes.
394441	395082	I like to.
395363	396466	Permission granted.
396967	399533	Put an apron over your new bosom, too.
399935	401456	Don't tell her, but I got them cheap.
401777	402497	Both lefties!
403358	405600	So, Bobby, what's it gonna do with your life?
405921	407822	I'm gonna be a prop comic.
407842	411266	I'm working on this bit where I stick a green bean up my nose.
411726	413047	Well, now that sounds promising.
413648	418413	Hank, Bobby and me have decided he's gonna stick vegetables up his nose.
418433	420675	He's not gonna take over the family gas station.
420695	423117	Dad, I don't work at a gas station.
423157	425639	I sell propane and propane accessories.
425759	426680	Don't sass me, boy!
427041	429503	You ain't too big for me to give you a licking!
429483	432588	Oh, dad, you old skunk.
432608	433650	Come on, grease monkey.
433931	434692	Let's tangle.
435433	436836	All right, Kyle.
436916	438338	Now, you are breaking my good dishes.
438619	439681	It's time for you to leave.
440903	441343	Come on.
441363	441924	Come on.
441944	445190	I will fix you a to-go plate.
445210	446452	Don't worry about the horse.
446472	448656	If it comes back, we'll call the rental place.
452095	453356	Damn, won't start.
453977	455258	I guess I'm not going anywhere.
455578	456379	Oh, no, no, no.
456559	457280	Just pop the hood.
457600	458661	Hank can fix it in a minute.
459241	460382	Don't bother, Uncle Hank.
460823	462464	I can't hear the solenoid plunger.
462985	464066	You're going to need a new one.
464486	465427	Thanks a lot, girly.
466047	467929	But the truth is, you're a girl.
468930	471873	Hank, we'll have to wait till your gas station opens up in the morning.
471893	472873	I guess I'm staying over.
473154	475576	I wish you could, but we are all out of beds.
475596	476356	I don't need a bed.
477498	481461	I can sleep in a drawer after what they did to me overseas.
481762	483564	I could sleep on the couch, Mom.
483584	484846	Well, that'll be just fine.
485046	486749	Excuse me for just a second.
486769	491255	I do not want that ill-mannered foul mouth old man to spend another moment in my house.
491535	493558	Oh, you just don't understand him, Peg.
493979	497583	See, he's a big flamboyant character like a peacock.
497924	499146	That's why men love him.
499506	503471	But women don't like his style because you all are like the pee hen.
503952	506115	More subdued and drab.
507023	510068	You just cannot see your father for who he is.
510389	512372	Well, Bobby and I both want him to stay.
512873	514356	So that means you're out voted.
514636	514937	Oh, yeah?
515317	516459	Well, Luann hates him, too.
516820	517862	That means we're even.
518342	520666	Well, Jesus loves him, so I win.
521167	524453	Well, what does that have to do with... Hey, Dad, we'd love it if you stayed.
524854	525695	Well, all righty.
526336	530804	Bitty, we're bunking here tonight.
530864	532727	Mr. Khan, my bag!
537297	539503	What do you say I drive you to school today, Bobby?
540024	541789	Hey, you fix my car yet?
542150	543213	I just woke up.
543513	544315	Just what?
544336	545519	It's 7 a.m.
545559	548727	If you were in the army, you could have dug 10 graves by now.
549228	550632	I hope you're all hungry.
550848	552470	Good looking breakfast, Peg.
552911	554333	Yeah, I see bacon.
554914	555755	I see ham.
556416	557257	I see steak.
557898	558919	Sausage!
558939	559860	Where's my sausage?
560141	561342	There's no sausage!
561583	567571	Well, Cotton, you are welcome to march yourself down to the safeway, but I have to get ready for work.
568653	569113	See you, Bobby.
569674	570255	Woman works.
570755	572157	Man loses his sausage.
573339	579167	You know, Cotton, I'd love to debate this with you, but I am just a little too busy living here in the latter half of the 20th century.
579873	583037	Hey dad, if you want to drive Bobby to school, use my truck.
583517	585279	I'll go rig up your pedal extenders.
587041	588903	You're all skin and bones, girly.
589504	591626	Put some cornpone on them hips.
591646	593488	I don't want any grandpa hell.
593869	594810	Don't want to get fat.
595310	596572	That's not for you to worry about.
597092	599174	You will never know if you are attractive.
599655	601117	It's up to a man to tell you that.
601617	604260	You keep eating, and I'll tell you when to stop.
604645	607489	Touch me again and go be wearing that cornpone, old man.
608410	608690	Really?
609271	609832	Feisty!
613957	617041	You sure it's okay for me to be out of school today, Grandpa?
617441	619123	Well, yeah, it's a holiday, isn't it?
619684	621346	It's Angie Dickinson's birthday.
622027	624430	Now, why don't you order us some food?
624450	624790	Really?
625571	627434	Dad never lets me order.
627454	628955	Yeah, well, you went with your daddy today.
629456	630197	Go to it.
632118	634121	Excuse me, ma'am.
635563	635763	Uh, ma'am.
635783	635963	Oh, good.
635983	636104	Sweet.
636124	636945	You'll never get no service that way.
636965	638948	You gotta get her in the moneymaker.
638968	639188	Hey, Missy.
639208	639809	How about some sandwiches?
639869	651325	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
652570	654032	Well, that's the dangedest thing.
654092	657416	I never heard of a solenoid just disappearing before.
658017	658518	I don't know.
658918	662182	Sometimes things just disappear for no logical reason.
662843	665827	One day my cousin woke up, his kidney was gone.
666488	673457	At the same time, five hundred miles away, a woman in Phoenix contracted diabetes.
674318	675760	I fixed it, Uncle Hank.
679570	681072	Oh, he purrs.
681092	682455	He's like, dang, old kid.
682815	685720	Yep, my dad sure knows how to take care of his cars.
686381	694875	When I was a baby, he had my mama make me a shammy jumpsuit, and I used to crawl around on the hood and buff it till it shined like Christmas.
695315	697038	Your dad, I swear.
697719	701065	How about when he took us down to the hotel, Arlen?
701085	701986	Oh, yeah.
702046	703148	Remember that, Hank?
708325	710788	Hank, you won the big game.
710808	714412	So, I'm buying you and your friends hookers.
714913	716735	Now come on, boys, pickers out that'll have one.
717255	718877	Hey there, Mr. Quarterback.
722361	725165	Not every dad would do something like that to his son.
725185	726987	I mean, for his son.
730331	732133	What, how's it coming with the car, grease monkey?
732553	734215	That's real funny, Peg.
734313	735294	Look what I found.
736015	737858	Wait, that's a solenoid.
737898	738759	Where'd you find that?
739040	743526	In Cotton's room, wrapped in his little bitty pants under a big pile of lies.
744027	746651	Damn it, I killed a whole day fixing that car.
747111	747993	I don't understand.
748013	749735	Oh, Hank, what is to understand?
750156	755063	Your father disfigured his own automobile just so he could stay here and drive me crazy.
755303	758568	Oh, Peggy, the poor guy just wants to spend time with us.
758988	762193	And you've made it so hard for him, he's afraid to ask.
762173	762734	You're right.
763154	763794	It's my fault.
764055	766917	Why didn't I serve that poor man his sausage?
767298	768459	What's the point in arguing?
768699	770200	The car is fixed now.
770280	771641	He'll be out of here tonight.
772282	775485	Aunt Peg, I found this timing belt in the laundry.
775845	777347	You want me to wash it with the darks?
778668	779809	Good morning, angels.
780389	782351	Do I have an assignment for you?
782892	783892	Good morning, Charlie.
784213	785774	Ah, damn!
786495	788176	It's a Shelley hack!
788196	790138	That's like getting a shimp.
790422	792205	What in the hell is going on here?
792726	794229	Where are your pants?
794249	795111	We were hot.
795131	795712	Take them off.
795992	799378	A man doesn't have to wear pants around the house if he doesn't want to.
799759	801682	Yeah, what you got them blue jeans on for, Hank?
802163	802604	Let's go.
802644	803345	Take them off.
803626	804908	I don't want to take them off.
805329	807673	Buddy, take your daddy's pants off.
808415	809717	Okie dokie cotton, Hank.
809737	810398	Fix your car.
810739	812703	I guess you'll be wanting to head back right about now.
813063	813544	Peggy.
814773	818078	Well, um, maybe we should think about getting back.
818098	818859	Huh, honey?
818879	819700	What did you say?
820482	821343	What did you say?
821363	821423	OK.
825730	827012	Now, what did you say, baby kinks?
827372	828273	We can leave.
828354	830497	Hank fixed the car.
831078	832340	Actually, Luann fixed it.
833001	837688	Oh, that's a good one, Hank's wife.
838208	839831	A woman fixing a car.
840191	842535	That's like a pig trying to read.
843511	843892	Yeah.
845475	848020	Well, I guess you can go home now, Dad.
848361	850385	Now, I don't think so.
850405	852429	We're gonna stick around a few more days.
853130	854172	Supper time, Colonel.
855816	858060	You've forgotten my beer!
858142	860524	Come on, get me my beer, woman.
861405	864228	Mom, I'll take my dinner in here, too.
864428	865289	Bobby, you will not.
865690	867091	We eat our dinner in the kitchen.
867512	868873	Boy wants his dinner in here.
869093	871215	Well, we eat in the kitchen.
871516	871756	Here.
871996	872356	Kitchen.
872457	872757	Here.
872897	873257	Kitchen.
873277	873618	Here.
873798	875800	I forgot, psych, I need a little support here.
876801	884269	Well, Peggy, it might be nice for a change to have dinner in front of the TV.
884689	887592	Well, go on, woman, get me my dinner.
890440	892103	I don't know where you got the idea.
892163	893945	You could slap your mother's behind.
893985	896810	I'll tell you where he got the idea.
897310	898012	Your father.
898412	900776	And it's all your fault for not nipping it in the bud.
900996	901937	What do you want me to do?
901958	903340	I can't change my father.
903540	905583	Well, he certainly won't listen to me now, will he?
906164	907105	You're both men.
907286	909068	You're both peacocks, remember?
909249	911612	What are you turning into some kind of feminist?
912113	914136	I am not a feminist, Hank.
914116	917821	I am Peggy Hill, a citizen of the Republic of Texas.
918382	923710	I work hard, I sweat hard, and I love hard, and I gotta smell good and look pretty while I'm doing it.
924071	931141	So I comb my hair, I reapply lipstick 30 times a day, I do your dishes, I wash your clothes, and I clean the house.
931482	938492	Not because I have to, Hank, but because of a mutual unspoken agreement that I have never brought up because I am too much of a lady.
939534	941136	30 times a day?
942382	943646	Yeah, I'm kind of like it here.
944007	945993	What kind of work can that guy get in this town?
946535	949183	Uh, are you allergic to asbestos?
949484	950026	Hello?
950527	951089	Hey, Dad.
951490	953657	Hey, if it ain't the ol' grease monkey!
953924	954725	All right, Dad.
955106	958572	I need to talk to you about some of the things you've been telling Bobby.
958953	960536	I've been telling Bobby a lot of things.
960636	964684	For example, I told him how I lost my shins defending our country.
965004	966166	You want to hear that story, Fatty?
966427	967268	Sure, yes, sir!
967749	970073	Bill, I'm trying to talk to my... I was 14.
970735	971997	Just a little older than Bobby.
972518	974341	But I knew Uncle Sam needed me.
974742	977046	So I lied and signed up.
978106	980349	And we had beaten the Nazis in Italy.
980369	982693	And they shipped us to the Pacific Theater.
983334	986979	A Tojo torpedo sent our troops ship to the bottom.
986999	989683	I could only save three of my buddies.
989703	992166	Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn.
992707	995271	They were kind of like you fellas, only one of them was from Brooklyn.
995932	1000418	Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero and put fifty bullets in my bow.
1001099	1002261	The blood attracted sharks.
1003283	1006307	I had to give them Fatty.
1007080	1008442	Then things took a turn for the worse.
1008802	1009824	I met it to an island.
1010705	1012968	But it was full of tojos.
1012988	1015391	They were spittin' on the US flag.
1015411	1016913	So I rushed them.
1016933	1018215	But it was a trap.
1018235	1022601	They opened fire and blew my skin off.
1022621	1027627	Last thing I remember, I beat them all to death with a big piece of fattie.
1028188	1032674	I woke up in a field hospital, and they were sewing my feet to my knees.
1034316	1034877	Now,
1035447	1038210	What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Hank?
1040592	1043094	Well, nothing, I guess.
1049941	1051622	You've had enough cake, Connie.
1052263	1052984	What are you doing?
1053564	1056327	A man's gotta tell a woman when to stop eating.
1056807	1058309	You're looking kind of chunky.
1059630	1060811	Oh, she's moody.
1061192	1062653	Must be PBS.
1065434	1066115	Let's go.
1066315	1068336	I gotta see a man about a horse.
1069217	1071059	Bobby, don't forget to bust your tray.
1072000	1073861	Ah, that's women's work.
1073881	1075002	Ain't that right, fellas?
1075963	1076924	Women's work!
1077684	1078645	Women's work!
1079146	1080447	Women's work!
1080467	1081448	Women's work!
1081888	1082929	Women's work!
1085291	1085551	Women's work!
1085571	1085831	Women's work!
1085851	1086111	Women's work!
1086132	1086392	Women's work!
1086412	1086672	Women's work!
1086692	1086972	Women's work!
1089134	1092577	Well, she's got a point, but he's a war hero.
1093858	1095019	She's my wife.
1095488	1097290	But he's got no shins.
1098571	1101235	Uh, I'm just trying to get a little propane here.
1103697	1104658	Stricklin' propane.
1104939	1107982	Bobby was sent home from school for starting a sexist riot today.
1108403	1108663	What?
1109164	1110805	I'm coming home right now.
1111106	1115671	Well, you're just a little too late, because the devil took Bobby off to the Hotel Arlen.
1115831	1116872	Hotel Arlen!
1124100	1124601	Bobby!
1125290	1127613	I'm proud of you for what you did at school today.
1128614	1130036	So I'm buying you a hooker.
1130416	1132278	Go ahead, pick yourself out alive way.
1132859	1134201	Alive one what?
1134942	1137084	Hey, cutie, you got papers?
1141810	1143652	Bobby, get over here now.
1144493	1146776	Grandpa said I could- Bobby, you heard your mother.
1146876	1147557	Get over there.
1148658	1149699	What are you saying, Hank?
1150320	1151922	Are you siding with your woman?
1152408	1153689	Look at me, son!
1154110	1155591	Look at my shins!
1156352	1161437	Look, Dad, I'm sorry about fatty and your shins, but I'm not a kid anymore.
1161958	1167063	Bobby is my boy, and I won't let him grow up to be a woman hating old fool.
1167584	1168865	No wonder Mom left you.
1169185	1172729	She was a strong lady, classy and smart like Peg.
1173149	1175171	Maybe you couldn't handle that, but I can.
1175732	1178635	My marriage is a partnership of equals.
1178615	1187667	Peggy might do all the housework, but there are a lot of other things that I'm supposed to do, but I'm not going to say what they are because I'm a gentleman.
1187687	1188268	Oh, I get it.
1188969	1190171	She's making you say this.
1190791	1191953	You're just her puppet.
1192253	1194697	No, Dad, I'm saying all this because I mean it.
1195137	1196459	Now, Dee Dee's out in the car.
1196539	1197440	I had her pack up.
1197520	1199002	It's time for you to head home.
1200204	1206833	Well, I never thought I'd see the day when my own son would stop loving me.
1213175	1215378	It's about time!
1216059	1217420	Love for sissies!
1218041	1223167	Ain't that right, ya house full of hookers?
1223187	1224829	All right, hookers, listen up.
1224850	1228214	I'll be back next year so don't be jacking up your prices.
1228955	1231618	I'll be staying over to Hank Hill's home.
1234041	1237906	Bobby, you gotta try and forget all that gobbledygook your grandpa told ya.
1238506	1240549	You listen to your mother, she knows best.
1240664	1241725	But she's a woman.
1241785	1243608	How could she know better than Grandpa?
1243868	1251518	Well, because she's a lot smarter than him for one, your mother's probably got a better head on her shoulders than anybody in Ireland.
1251538	1254723	Better than Bill, or Dale, or Boomerower?
1255063	1258528	Geez, Bobby, why not compare it to a baboon in the zoo?
1258848	1260951	But I thought they were your best friends.
1261032	1262874	Peggy's my best friend, son.
1263414	1263955	Mom?
1264335	1264856	That's right.
1265457	1269641	And when you're older, I hope you're lucky enough to find a girl to be best friends with, too.
1270422	1271823	You think that'll really happen to me?
1272324	1275747	Well, it won't if you keep slapping them in the butt and ordering them around.
1276208	1276968	You'll do okay.
1276988	1278770	You just have to remember one thing.
1279451	1282514	Women were not put on this earth to serve you and me.
1283075	1285437	Now, what do you say we get an ice cream?
