Wait a minute.
There.
One of the leaves just moved.
You're shoving it with the nozzle, Bill.
Well, that's what you get for buying a Japanese leaf blower.
It's built for blowing those little bonsai bushes and cherry blossoms.
For crying out loud, it's 5.30.
Will you pucks turn off that racket maker?
It's called a leaf blower pops, runs on a new fangled device called the gasoline engine.
What the hell's wrong with using a rake?
You lazy punks.
A rake, you say?
I never heard of a rake, if you, Bill.
Uh, nope.
Must've been before our time.
Yeah, man.
I'll tell you what, man.
I seen a dang old rake over there down Miss... Missonian, man.
Right next to Lincoln's, I had him in the arch-chair, man.
A dang old caveman section.
Don't you cuss at me, Jimmy Dean.
I'll sick my dog on you.
See ya, pups!
Keep watchin' touch by an angel!
Here comes the shut-in.
Lucky kid.
The doctor says getting chickenpox at the age of 12 could cause sterility in weaker children.
My Joseph better not be sterile.
I need my seed to live on.
Certain plans of mine require additional gribbles.
Bobby, I'm proud of you.
Getting over the chickenpox is a milestone.
So to celebrate, you can do anything you want.
How about we go to the Family Fun Center?
Yay!
The Family Fun Center!
They have go-karts, and ski-ball, and many... golf.
I like their blood pressure machine.
Can we, Dad?
Oh boy, there goes that rock man again.
That's not rock.
It's okay if you only know three chords, but God, put them in the right order.
That noise has been given Nancy Headaches all week.
Then yesterday, her back broke out in scratch marks.
Well, I'll go over and straighten them out.
Uh, Yuck.
I wonder if that music is what killed this grass.
Uh, fellas, could I have your attention, please?
Wow, Cain Skriderberg.
You're that 12th grader who put dough in all the stop signs.
Peace.
fellas my name is hank hill and i'm the block captain now it's not that i don't like music it's just that i don't like music i don't like music hey now cut that out this is serious
Oh, my lord.
You've got five plugs and one outlet here.
Does your father know you're doing this?
My dad's dead.
Oh.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
My condolences.
Does your mother know you're doing this?
My mom's in prison for killing my dad.
Okay, I get it.
You're joking.
Well, I've got a sense of humor.
I laugh at Tony Danza.
Of course, if you aren't joking, I feel bad and I apologize.
I laugh at Tony Danza.
I laugh at Tony Danza.
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna count to three.
One, two, three!
I'm not horsing around here.
Lucky for you, I don't have time for this right now.
Come on, Bobby, let's go to the Fun Center.
Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center, Fun Center.
Please, Dad, can we please play paintball?
Now, hold on a minute.
Let's see, they give you kids guns and let you shoot at each other?
Yeah, okay.
Kids will be out there an hour or two.
We can get in some nice, relaxed... Ball guy.
Dad, these older guys corner us in a hall and they kept firing and firing.
They made us eat leaves.
What?
Who did this to you?
Cain Scratiberg.
Yeah, I'm a singer.
Got my own band.
Play next week at the park and ride.
Wow, this is a really good Xerox of you.
Hey, you!
What is wrong with you picking on little kids like that?
How would you like it if someone bigger and stronger shot you up, you little freak?
Cain Skredeberg has never been shot.
Yeah, Cain.
And the first guy to do it's not going to be some fat old desk jockey.
Desk jockey?
Hey, I am a finely tuned ex-high school athlete.
I spent four years holding guys like you upside down over toilets.
I don't care how many guys you held in the men's room.
He still can't beat us.
What do you say?
You want to teach some punks little respect?
Oh, yeah!
Very little.
Okay.
Your goal is to capture the blue flag from over there and bring it back here.
When you get hit, you're dead.
Alright, man.
Let's paint some ass.
I think we're closing in on him.
Only talk if you have something important to say.
Okay.
Oh, I got some important news in the mail this morning.
Did you know that thanks to Colonial Valley, I can purchase term life insurance for only pennies a month?
Boy, I'm glad I opened that immediately.
You gotta do it, Bill.
I can't afford not to.
Shh!
This is it, guys.
Everybody hunker down.
Okay, man.
This is no time to go easy on these punks.
That's the mistake their parents made.
Hey, they're over here!
I heard the ball guy split his pants!
Drop your weapons or stuff for the consequences!
What?
We lost the game already?
March, prisoners!
Now, wait a minute.
No one told us anything about prisoners.
Where's that damn ref?
Attention, golfers!
We have captured your comrades!
Hey, Hank.
Hey, keep your eyes on the ball.
Nothing going on here, just teaching some punks a lesson.
That's my dad!
On your knees, prisoners!
It's the rules.
You're not cheaters, are you?
These kind of games go back and forth like basketball.
They're in the lead now, but we're coming back.
Wait a minute, you can't just execute my man.
Later, pops.
Pops?
God, how humiliating.
Later, Pops.
Afternoon, everybody.
Who wants a cold one?
You want a cold one?
Got some cold ones here that are cold.
That sure is cold, all right.
Maybe I should have brought mittens.
How long are we going to keep up this false charade?
Rod, man, I tell you what I mean.
What are their words for that charade?
I need a cold one.
You want a cold one?
Here's a cold one for you.
Here's a cold one for you.
Here's a cold one for you.
I hope you're all happy.
There's no cold ones left for me.
Open up your eyes, man.
You're holding a beer.
Oh, you call this beer?
Guatamolica?
Who bought this stuff?
Not me.
Of course not, bill by beer.
No need to do that when you got friends to mooch off of.
Hey, hey, hey, some friends you are.
When my wife left me because I was lazy and dependent, did even one of you find me a new one?
No.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I can't stand fighting.
Yeah, we know that.
You showed that on the paintball field.
I am not a coward.
Let go.
I'm a bully, man, yo.
Ah, what are you doing?
I'm helping Bobby look like Kain.
He's so cool.
He said I could be the stubborn stains his groupie.
The word is roadie, Bobby.
He meant roadie.
At least a hope to God.
Oh Hank, for goodness sake just put on your glasses.
Only old people need glasses to read.
I use mine to drive and run and jump.
Hank, I am giving you a look.
Uh, okay.
Oh
What is it those kids I can't take it anymore so tell them to knock it off who me I I've already got my slippers off maybe you should tell them
Hank, have you forgotten who you are?
You are Hank Freakin' Hill.
The man who won the Texas Propane Association Blue Flame of Ballard Award.
The man who drove raccoon after raccoon out of our attic armed only with a broom handle and a pillowcase.
And the man who sperm struggled through that tiny urethra God cursed you with to create our wonderful son.
Now, you go back out there and get yourself a rematch.
You really think we could beat him this time?
Well, I know a few raccoons who'd say Hank Hill can do anything he puts his mind to.
Uh, anything?
Dad!
The raccoons are back!
Rematch!
I thought we agreed never to discuss the horrors that we saw on the killing fields of the Fun Center.
This is not over.
We're not losers and we're not quitters.
Those paintballs really hurt, don't they?
I mean, I'm just saying what everybody thinks, right?
The way I see it, we're at a critical moment here.
Is this when we start turning into the weird old guys of the block who can't open up their doors without finding a flamin' fudge bag on the mat?
Or do we fight back?
We fight back a lot, hard, dude!
Rematch, tomorrow, noon.
If you got any guts, you'll be there.
Sorry, Pops.
My car broke down.
Rematch, tomorrow, noon.
If you got any guts, you'll be there.
Well, at least this time one of us got a shot off.
Sorry, Bill.
Mm-hmm.
Yipper.
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah, sorry.
Then it's agreed.
We're old.
I'll get used to it.
You're in for the downhill ride of your life.
You know, with Colonial Valley, you can get $40,000 in stroke coverage just for signing up.
Let's not chump change.
Yeah, and you can never be denied coverage based on what you eat.
Well, I guess I better check this out.
It's never too early to think about dying.
Those damn kids.
We said we were old.
What do they want from us?
Boys just kids having their fun Hank.
Don't try to figure them out.
They can't be figured.
Just shake your fist at them like this.
They won't come back.
I thought you said they wouldn't come back.
Hey, if I could understand teenagers, I wouldn't get my mailbox knocked over every week.
Hmm.
Hey, maybe that's it.
Well, what's it?
If we don't want to end up feeble and helpless like Pops, we've got to do what he never did.
Understand the mind of a teenager.
Observe its habits, learn its ways.
That's how we beat those punks.
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
Who's Pops?
Teenagers can be so cruel.
Okay, pimples, hop on up.
Buckley, I'm going to Kane's concert as his special guest, not his girlfriend.
I don't know, I don't trust this guy.
Well, if you're so worried, come with me.
Kang told me to bring a friend for the drummer.
Oh, you mean it?
Oh, stuck boy.
We need some sugar in aisle three.
Oh snap.
Teenagers are clumsy around girls.
Hey, Jerk Wad, you sprayed poison on my veggie wrap.
Teenagers show no respect for a man in uniform.
Hey, Pops!
How did you know to find us here?
Well, it's a school day, isn't it?
So, you ready for a fresh coat?
You boys seem pretty sure of yourselves.
Maybe you'd like to put a little wager on today's match.
Well, what do you have in mind?
Let's make the stakes high for both of us.
You put up your amplifier and I'll put up Bill's leaf blower.
Alright.
You got a deal.
Guys, guys, where are you?
Ow!
Oh!
I twisted my ankle.
Time out!
Time out, everyone!
Guys, oh, seriously, I give up.
Don't shoot.
Uncle?
You were right, Bill.
Teenagers are cruel.
They'll pick on the slowest, heaviest... Well, the important thing is you were right, Bill.
I still don't see why I had to be the decoy.
Oh, you were gonna get shot anyway.
Still.
Hey, it's Luyan.
How you doing?
What, me?
Leave a message after the beep.
Beep.
Beep!
Big, big, big, big!
Stop, man, they're gonna watch you that friendly fire.
Man, you're gonna let them frag me like I'm a dang old... I can't help it.
They trained me too well.
I am the most efficient killing machine the world has ever... Ow.
Three down and... One to go.
Hey, did you see some pot-bellied old guy with loser glasses come up from past year?
Uh, sure.
He's traveling up the creek bed to cover his tracks.
Oh, and, uh, young fella, you lose.
Hey, his scoop's bigger.
I think you're gonna enjoy the world of acoustics.
This sucks!
Who could that be?
Good lord!
That could start a fire!
Now what's happening?
He's stomping it good.
And there's duties in there, right?
There sure is, Pops.
There sure is.
Dad!
The raccoons are back!
