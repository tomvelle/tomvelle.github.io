Good evening customer service.
Yes, I had some suggestions I'd like to talk to you about.
A talker.
You have reached our automated suggestion center.
Please leave your message for Philip Martin.
But then the rash went away and I could wear pants again.
Yep.
Dale, Hank's going to become a tugboat captain.
Yep.
Gla, gla, X-Nac, Bungaloo.
No one listens to me.
Do you guys think horses remember things from when they were little?
The picture's so blurry.
Is that what's his name from 90210 or what's his name from growing up Brady?
I'm fed up with this TV.
We have got to get a new one.
Perhaps even a flat screen TV?
Absolutely.
Okay, whatever it is, let's just slow down here.
We don't need an expensive flat screen TV, Peggy.
That CSI lady looks just fine on the TV we've already got.
Well, sure we don't need one, Hank, but I want one, and I am prepared to pay for it myself.
You haven't sold a house in six months, Peggy.
You know, if you put it on a credit card, I still have to pay for it.
You don't think I can pay for this TV, do you, Hank?
Well, uh... No.
Bobby, get ready for the biggest, flattest TV you have ever seen in your life.
Peggy, you don't have to do this.
We'll just keep the TV we have.
No.
Let her do it, Dad.
It will help her to heal.
I shopped around all day, and the good flat screens still cost a lot more than I have in my savings.
Good flat screens?
Oh, you mean like this?
Yes, men like that.
I will get the money somehow.
I just have to come up with a clever invention.
Something that lights up and that kids put on their shoes.
Or you could get another job.
I bet there's a lot of wives that would like you to be their husband's secretary.
No need to work for TV money.
Make your personal savings work for you.
Listen to my secret friend.
The Dow Genius.
So we had a down day in the market.
Do we get scared?
No!
We go to Brazil, where they are cornering the bird flu vaccine market, by Bioteca de Brasilia, symbol B-D-S-A.
Well, this is amazing.
I am in for a thousand.
I will buy a gigando new TV.
For hike, it'll be 79 inches of so there.
Maybe I go in for a grand myself.
I'll sell a few guns and invest too.
Financial dignity might be an interesting switch for me.
Men, our stock has lost 20% in a few days.
Is there any chance we can return our stocks at the earlier price?
OK, so the market's had a downturn.
The genius feels your pain.
Ow, ow, ow.
This is crazy.
Every time we obey his shouting, I lose more money.
We should just cut our losses.
I'm going to admit failure and ask Nancy to reinstate my allowance.
No, I will not be a failure or look like one.
I have got to win at this.
We are overdue.
Come on, you idiot.
Tell us something brilliant.
People, you have to remember that everybody invests differently.
When the market is slow, buy what you know.
Buy the companies that make what the average people are buying.
He has a point.
We need to study America and invest in what America wants to buy.
OK?
Good.
What?
What do people like to buy?
I don't know.
Leechy nuts?
Upper CDs?
Those new Russian bullets will go through anything.
Oh, no, not you two.
America.
What does Joe blow by?
B2B.
I give up.
Then we are going on a field trip.
America, roll up your sleeve.
Piggy Hill is about to take your pulse.
OK, they are the pixels, but not popcorn.
Chocolate snack cakes are sold out, too, but not pound cake.
There has to be a pattern here.
There's no pattern, Peggy.
It's like Americans are just a bunch of pigs rooting aimlessly in the dirt.
Look at that.
Who on earth would buy something as repulsive as chocolate-covered potato chips?
Sorry, man.
Oh, hi, man.
I'm just so excited they restocked the chocolate-covered potato chips.
These things fly off the rack.
Mine!
I need extra so I'm covered for the weekends.
Man, look what's in Bill's cart.
He got the snack cakes, the pretzels, the aerosol cheese.
What he buys, the rest of them buy.
about it.
Bill is middle-aged, obese, with disposable income and poor impulse control.
He is the average American consumer.
Bill is our golden pig.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I need Dumbo Wrap.
Megalorap.
Check.
What on earth he rapping with that much rap?
The American consumer doesn't know.
All it knows is it must rap.
You know, I know it's just Bill, but something doesn't feel right about this.
Do you think we should tell him?
We can't tell him.
People act most natural when they don't know they're being observed.
I cite as evidence several hundred episodes of candid camera.
Hmm, let's see.
I like shopping with all of you.
Usually the only people who talk to me in stores are older gay men who have dropped their standards.
Well, buy something already.
Okay.
I've read about this.
A mini jungle gym for your cats to play in.
You don't have any cats.
Well, I might.
So Bill, where you feel like going for lunch, huh?
So, that's a real Italiano.
Home of the spaghetti sandwich.
I recommend the jumbo spaghetti sandwich.
It's my favorite.
Well, it certainly is popular and publicly traded.
This one here is top of the line.
If it's the top of the line, I'll take it.
Care to add a super surround system with ultra stereo boost?
Throw it in!
Well, here we go.
Everyone ready?
Oh my gosh, I'm turning down!
Turn him down!
Oh my gosh, I'm turning down!
Turn him down!
Oh my gosh, I'm turning down!

I cannot believe this amazing TV is really in our house!
Yeah, Peggy, how did you afford this?
I mean, it had to be pretty expensive.
Hugely expensive, but that does not matter anymore.
I am so excited I can finally tell you.
I have discovered a secret gold mine.
Uh, I don't like the way you just said gold mine.
What do you mean?
So, we made all this crazy money just by studying Bill.
You don't look proud of me anymore.
Well, I wonder why not?
Peggy, you used Bill.
You have to fix this.
I hope you're not going to say we should get rid of the TV.
Of course not.
It's incredible.
But you have to tell Bill what you've been doing.
Promise me you'll do that.
Then let's go back to watching this amazing thing.
So you were studying me?
You listened to me.
My opinions made a difference.
So you're not mad?
No, I'm honored that you cared what I thought.
You folks feeling like dessert?
Yeah, Bill, dessert.
What do you want to have, huh?
Hmm, good point.
What does Bill want for dessert?
And it displays windows within windows.
I still haven't figured out how to make those go away, though.
It's so nice when people care what you have to say.
Hank, why didn't you ever tell me what it was like?
Well, I'm just happy you're okay with it.
I thought it might make you angry.
Of course, you thought Bill would think that, but only Bill knows what Bill thinks.
You have this nice TV because I have the power of being me.
Bill, you don't have powers.
It works because you're so typical.
Bill, you're not the one who's typical.
I am.
I buy things, and it makes money so we can buy more things.
I'm like an ecosystem.
Dad, look!
Two Rob Schneider movies on screen at the same time.
You're welcome, Bobby.
So, how are our profits this week?
Minimal.
We need to diversify.
All our positions are still in junk food and cat toys.
Pedge funds, global indicators.
Hey, this tech sector stuff must be important.
The article on it is really long.
Check this out.
There's a big computer trade show in Austin next week.
Okay, computers.
What will Bill pick for us?
Robots?
I hope he chooses some robots.
Wow.
It's so incredible.
So, this is the future, huh?
I don't know.
Everybody's so cool.
It's not about being cool, Bill.
Most people aren't cool.
This is about what regular Americans are going to buy.
Now, digital cameras.
What do you like?
I just... I don't know.
I mean... I think... Don't think about it.
Just be Bill.
Come on, Bill.
Just pick something.
I... I... I... Damn it.
We broke him.
He's useless now.
This is classic Heisenberg, the observer effect.
Observer?
What?
The very act of observation interferes with the outcome.
Often misattributed to Heisenberg, who was wrong about the bomb, but right about uncertainty.
See now, you're watching you, and that's the problem.
It shows up in AI theory too.
Quite so.
Anyway, this thing is a wash.
You're broken.
Game over.
Oh, dang it.
I was gonna get Hank a lazy boy with the fringe in it.
They had those.
It was pretty good while it lasted.
No!
It's not over!
I can still do it!
America will love... This!
Louis Camaric!
I'm still Bill!
I can pick winners!
Nobody can be Bill like me!
I'll show them.
I have to show them.
This is 24-7 stocks, so what are we trading?
Hey!
If I use my savings and take out a second mortgage on my house, can I open the trading account?
You betcha.
Good, because I want to buy, buy, buy!
Well, what do we do next?
Now that Bill's melted down, he won't be any help anymore.
How about we try to doubt genius again?
Let me put it this way.
ZNE Technologies is like a mafia wife.
Do not touch!
Okay, next caller is Bill from Texas.
Howdy, cowboy.
I've gone broke!
Well, maybe it's not our bill.
Okay, bill from all in Texas is broke.
Happens to the best of us, big man.
So what do you got for me?
Uh-oh.
Please, please help me.
I've mortgaged my house.
I used all my savings to invest in a sure thing, but then... Whoa, Slim, you telling me you bet your whole nut on one stock?
Give me the nutcracker!
Let's see it!
Don't laugh at me.
I was once a stock picking genius, but I made so much money for my friends that I did it for me.
We're still not 100% certain that was our bill.
Men, are you home, Peggy?
Anyone?
Maybe we should just go out there and talk to him.
And say what?
Sorry, your life is somehow even worse than it was.
Yeah, besides, we didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, come on.
We use him for our own gain until we broke him and then we cast him aside.
Then, in a desperate attempt to regain our love, he lost everything he owned.
But other than that, we're good, right?
What are these words?
Can't we get rid of those guys?
Who are they?
No idea.
Dang it, there are so many buttons on this remote.
Ugh.
It hurts my eyes.
It's too detailed.
This is what madness must feel like.
Oh, thank goodness.
Somehow it went to sleep.
Now what?
What's that voice?
It's just Bill.
He doesn't sound too good.
My strategy was sound.
I leveraged liquidity, but there are negative market corrections.
Overall I give myself an A for theory.
Bill, you don't know what any of those words mean.
I just wanted people to listen to me, Hank.
So awful being ignored.
You know what's going to be even more awful?
You're going to lose your house.
How much are you on the hook for?
A lot.
And not my usual a lot this time I'm being accurate.
Dang it.
All right, I'm going to go find the others.
He was on sleep, and then it stopped sleeping.
Don't leave us alone with it.
Unplug it to be sure!
Who knows what it'll do next?
Oh, thank God!
I thought you were Bill!
How could you three do this?
You know the way Bill is, but you took him out for a spin anyway.
It's like you had a truck with faulty brakes, but you just didn't care.
We feel terrible.
I want to help, but the Gribbles have a long history of making things worse.
Well, I guess we could sell off our holdings to pay off Bill's mortgage ourselves.
Hank, I know how much you love it, but the TV came from using Bill and I- Sell it.
Yes.
Anything to, uh, help our friend.
You are an inspiration, Hank.
$5,000?
That's nowhere near enough.
The man mortgaged his house.
How about this?
Instead of selling off more guns, I could just leave a few out on Bill's doorstep and let come what may.
Let's just give him this much.
It's better than nothing, and at least we tried.
Thank you all.
It's awfully generous, but I won't need this money now.
It turns out after all that- You know that working man get a cold beer around here?
In the kitchen?
Even total strangers don't care if they interrupt me.
Sorry, Bill.
Looks like he's here helping Buck move the TV today.
Go on.
What's the use?
Anyway, thanks for the money, but I'm safe now.
I declared bankruptcy this morning.
You declared bankruptcy?
Oh, it's Texas Hank.
They're pretty efficient about this sort of thing.
They even had a special easy-broke phone line.
Anyway, I won't take up any more of your time.
Whoa, hold on friend, not so fast.
Did you just say you got a bona fide state certified bankruptcy?
Yeah.
Oh, how does that work?
Do you have to declare all your assets, or can you keep your offshore money?
And who are you hiding your money from, your wife, the government?
I want to go bankrupt someday.
I just want to owe a little more first.
Is it hard to pull off?
Oh, no, it was so easy.
Even I could do it.
Well, don't just repeat that part, my man.
Give us the whole gory details.
Wow.
I can't believe you want to hear what I have to say.
Well, Buck, if you hand me that beer, I'll tell you all about it.
Fantastic.
This could take a while.
Man, I'm all over this.
Apparently, there are a lot of bankruptcies.
The Easy Broke guy was very helpful.
Let me tell you, it's pretty scary seeing all those zeros at first, but...
Hank's going to become a tugboat captain.
