Hey kid, where's your hall pass?
You got me.
My name is Ramon Tavares.
I'm in Mr. Powell's class.
Ramon Tavares?
And why does your lunch bag say Bobby Hill?
Because we can't spell Ramon.
What did I say?
All right, get going, Ramon.
Bobby Hill?
Yeah.
Oh, you're good.
Yep yep yep mm-hmm
They dumped it right where we stand.
That's where we stand.
Why would somebody leave a couch behind my house?
I know how it got here.
One of them firefighting planes scooped it up out of Lake Arlen.
Man, you don't talk about them dang old urban legend with you, man.
Man, he don't suck that like that fellow with the toothbrush up in that man's bottom, man.
That's the whole truth, too, man, happened to me.
Oh, hey, look, treasure.
You rubber man.
Sugar cube.
Mmm.
Have a little pride, Bill.
If we eat their garbage, we're not much better than they are.
Probably had a coffee table.
Oh, if this old couch could talk.
My name... My name is Hank Taxpayer, and I want that couch removed.
There are people who stand in that alley.
We talk.
Well, that's not really your business, is it?
Sports mostly, you know.
Hey guys, you gotta see this.
Bobby, do that walk again.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What's so funny about that?
It's adult humor, Connie.
I don't even get some of it.
It could be weeks before the city comes and hauls this away.
What?
You say something, Mac?
This is ridiculous.
I say we get rid of the couch ourselves.
Bill, what are you doing?
I'm drinking beer.
I'm sitting on the couch and I'm outside.
I'm just gonna take a break.
Five minutes.
That's all.
Man, what do you love sitting like a bunch of dang old leo couch jockey sleazy on sitting up like a... Man, look up in the sky, man.
It's a dang old... Sorry, man.
It don't look up here, man.
Come on, Hank.
All right.
But if I don't like it, I'm standing right back up.
Hello.
Hi, can I speak to Bobby, please?
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Who was it, Dad?
Oh, girl.
Asking for someone named Bobby.
Oh.
Hello.
Hi.
Does Bobby Heldup there?
Uh, hold on a second.
Son, it's one of your friends playing a prank.
Hey, Joseph.
Bobby, it's Marie.
Oh.
Hey.
A bunch of us are going to hang out at the mall on a come.
Well, I did have a prior engagement but I can always tape it.
So what are you gonna get, Marie?
Well, I don't eat anything with a head on it.
Well, I'm a vegetarian, Bobby.
I don't eat meat.
My dad says if God didn't want us to eat meat, he wouldn't have invented steak sauce.
Your dad says that?
Once.
Bobby, did you know that the average person consumes 500 chickens?
That's enough chickens to feed a whole starving village.
But they shouldn't eat them.
Because that's bad.
I'll have the chopped salad, please.
And I'll have the BLT, please.
That has bacon, Bobby.
Bacon doesn't have a head on it.
Could you make that an LT, please?
Tonight was fun, Bobby.
My friends think you're a riot.
I really was choking at the food court, but don't tell them that.
Hey, there's a couch in the alley.
Sit down.
You want a kiss?
Well, I'll try anything once.
I didn't think I'd like fruit pies, but then I tried one.
And if your kiss is anything like a fruit pie, I'm sure I... All right.
See you around.
Mom, Dad, did you see the sunrise this morning?
It was the same color as my girlfriend Marie's hair.
Here's your coffee, sweet meat.
Reminds me of my girlfriend Marie.
She likes to drink her coffee black, too.
Huh, looks like they're finally gonna cut down the big oak tree that's in the middle of the ballpark.
I'm not sure what my girlfriend Marie thinks about that.
I'll ask her.
Alright, Bobby.
I'll bite.
Why do you keep saying the word, girlfriend?
Because I have a girlfriend.
Bobby has a girlfriend?
Alright, son.
She's real, right?
I mean, she's not imaginary or on a cereal box or anything, is she?
No.
All right.
Well, I assume that she's your girlfriend, just like Joseph is your boyfriend.
Peggy, Joseph is not Bobby's boyfriend.
Red alert!
The garbage jug's here!
You're not taking it!
Sir, can you ask this gentleman to get off the couch so we can do our job?
Bill, don't move a muscle.
Good work, Bill.
All right, but if you leave it out, somebody's gonna haul it away.
Go to hell.
So, what do you want to do, guys?
Let's go bike riding.
That's boring.
Yeah, that's a little boring, Connie.
I mean, maybe there's something else we all could do.
We could go shopping for clothes at the mall.
Hey, that's a great idea!
For quality purposes, some portions of this telephone conversation may be recorded.
Gribble residents.
Hey, Dale.
I just phoned to talk about the couch.
You know, just thinking about the couch.
Ooh, Bill, this is so strange.
I was just about to call you about the couch.
Yeah, you know the only thing better than talking about the couch?
Hey, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I see you out there.
All right.
I wonder what happened to your friends.
I don't know.
They were following us to the mall and then they were gone.
Oh, look, the couch.
You want a kiss?
Nah, I gotta go.
You know, Marie, the other night when you wanted to kiss, I didn't feel like it, but I did it anyway.
You have to respect my needs too.
Okay, whatever.
Ah!
Bobby?
Okay Bobby, I gotta go.
Good night, Marie.
Can I have some rice and plain toast, please?
My girlfriend Marie's a vegetarian, and she says... Ah, there it is.
I knew this was too good to be true.
So, she's a vegetarian.
She still likes lots of things I like.
Like, kissing, for instance.
Oh, my word.
Hank, talk to the boy.
Bobby, vegetarians can't be trusted.
Just last week, we caught one of them siphoning gas out of a company truck.
No, I was talking about the kissing.
He's too young.
You would think that, but I am such a good kisser, Mom.
Marie says so.
You should have seen it.
She bent my head back.
She hugged her again.
Bobby, Bobby, you are only 12.
You should be afraid of girls.
You're just jealous because you aren't as in love as me and Marie.
Bobby, I really don't think you can compare a two-day infatuation to a 20-year marriage.
I bet Marie and me have kissed more in two days than you have in your whole marriage.
You know, I don't think I've ever seen you guys kiss.
Your father has kissed me.
Hangy!
I'm not afraid to show my love.
You are.
Your father and I have done things you can't even imagine.
Peggy, please.
Oh, I'm flattered that you asked me to help you with your algebra homework, Connie.
Uh, actually, Luan, I don't need you to teach me algebra.
Oh, thank God.
Well, as you know, Bobby has a girlfriend.
Bobby has a girlfriend?
And I know it?
Yes.
And, well, it's made me realize that I really like Bobby.
What should I do, Luan?
Well, if you and Bobby are meant to be, then it'll happen.
I mean, Buckley and I weren't meant to be, and that's why he blew up.
Excuse me, I have an outside couch.
What do you have to keep the squirrels away?
Out, Jack.
Peggy, what are you doing?
Hank, remember how we used to hold hands in broad daylight?
Come on, honey.
Hold my hand.
I wish I could, but my hands are full, see?
I guess Bobby was right.
Maybe we are afraid to show our love.
All right.
I'll get a room you two.
Yeah.
What did you do to my old couch?
We're not fallin' for it, Conn.
This was not yours.
I get rid of it after a neighborhood cat come inside and pee all over it.
We try to dump it in front of Gribble's yard, but Min cut her leg on a tack, so we dump it here.
Ah, I get it.
He's seen what we've done with it.
Now he wants it back.
Gribble, you crazy?
I don't want it back.
Oh hey, I got an old pair of boxes so that you can use that T-cozy.
Want that too?
Hey, is Bobby home?
Who are you?
I'm Marie.
How old are you?
Fourteen.
Fourteen?
I don't know what Bobby's been telling you, but he's only twelve.
He's been telling me lots of things.
How come you never hold your wife's hand?
See you later, Dad!
Bobby's Marie is 14 years old.
What?
Oh, God.
That means when she was three, our Bobby was only one.
It makes me sick just thinking about it.
Hey, is this a make-out party?
Because if it is, I'm prepared for that.
The lady doesn't want to dance, don't make her dance!
Hey, come on kid, move out of the way.
Bobby, move.
Murray!
Bobby, what are you doing?
Why were you dancing with those guys?
I don't know who I like dancing.
I wanted to dance.
Who were those guys?
Why were you dancing with all those guys?
Bobby, they're friends.
We were just dancing.
What about us?
You're supposed to dance with just me.
And maybe some of your girlfriends, but mostly just me.
Bobby, this is getting way too intense.
We're only friends.
I thought we were more than that.
Bobby, you're a funny guy.
You make me laugh, that's all.
But we kissed!
Yes, and I'm looking back now.
Maybe that was a mistake.
Mistake!
That was the single most important thing in my life!
Look, Bobby, I don't think we should hang out together anymore.
Just tell me why you were dancing with all those guys!
Goodbye, Bobby.
You kissed me.
That means we're back together again.
Murray, come back.
Look, I'm doing your favorite comedy bit.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Somebody push you off your bike, son?
Marie broke up with me.
Oh, it doesn't feel so good, does it, son?
No.
I guess your love wasn't as strong as your father's in mind now, was it?
No, it wasn't.
I kissed Marie on this couch.
Now, Hank, that's not what this couch is for.
Yeah, Hank, you know you have to put it to a boat if you want a family member to use a couch.
All right.
Bobby, I know it's not good when a girl breaks your heart.
It's only natural to be sad.
But the couch is a happy place.
Really stopped crying.
That's a step in the right direction.
The boys taste and music's getting better too.
Mom, I'm never gonna make anyone laugh ever again.
I don't want to be a prop comic.
No flavor.
Not now.
Look at it this way, Bobby.
Tonight you're going out on a date with your parents.
And we know how you like going out with people older than you.
I'm on a date with my two favorite men, look at me.
A cup of rice, plain toast, and I'll help myself to the salad bar.
Thank you.
Is that her?
Ah, now it all makes sense.
She looks exactly like me.
Dad, I want to go home.
You can't let her get to you, son.
If you leave, she wins.
And dating's all about who wins and who loses.
Yee-haw!
Welcome to the Panhandler.
Would any of you fine folks care to take on our 72-ounce top sirloin steak?
Finish it in an hour and it's free.
I know, thank you.
Yes, I would.
That's a lot of meat, son.
What happened to being a vegetarian?
And I want it rare.
Okay, the rules are simple.
No one is allowed to help you chew or cut the meat.
And if you get sick before the finish, the contest is over.
Good luck!
Let's give them a little encouragement, folks!
Had a boy, Bobby.
You can do it, son.
Shovel it in, honey.
Don't be afraid to use all your teeth.
That's it, Bobby.
36 down, only 36 ounces to go, son.
Tighten that slab of beef, Bobby.
You're just making a fool of yourself, Bobby.
Nobody's impressed.
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, kids.
Slice and swap.
It's a snake-eat machine.
Oh.
Come on, Mom.
Dad, we're leaving.
Thank you.
Thank you, Arlen.
Hey, you two, I'm trying to eat.
Well, son, the worst part's over.
And now you'll realize just how silly... Oh, the couch is gone!
No!
We didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
Hi, Bobby.
Oh, hey Connie.
Bobby, are you okay?
Me and Marie just broke up.
You're taking it pretty hard.
You must have really liked her a lot.
Oh, no.
No, I just ate a 72-out steak dinner in 37 minutes.
Oh, when you finish, do you want to come over to my house and watch some television?
Doesn't have to be television.
Well, I don't know, Dale.
No, I didn't see a thing.
I bet the city just hauled it away.
I know Dale, I know, I miss it too.
Maybe it's all for the best, you know, we were starting to depend on that catch too much.
It's probably all for the best.
The End
