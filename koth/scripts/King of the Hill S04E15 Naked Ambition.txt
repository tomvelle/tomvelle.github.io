Shouldn't she be wearing a life vest?
No!
Let's go, Cajunia!
I'll see you later, Bobby.
Wait, I can ride home with you.
We could sit in the back and hold hands.
Maybe next time.
My mom's got this new moisturizer I've been sneaking.
Very smooth.
My hands are still pruney.
It wouldn't be fair to you.
What?
You still haven't told them we're dating.
It's not you, Bobby.
It's just... My dad has his heart set on me going out with Chane with Sana-Song.
Who, us, Na-Song?
Chane.
He's Laotian.
But does he make you laugh?
You are getting sleepy, sleepy!
You will tell your parents about us, and you will quit smoking.
I'll tell them.
I promise.
Son, why is there a towel on your head?
You, sir, are getting sleepy.
From now on, you will buy only brand-name cola.
Just go change.
Hey, boom hour!
Peggy won't let me in her car!
Can I go home with you?
No way, man.
This little dang ol' ass trap raised, man.
I don't know if it doesn't know when the sun and the dark side of the moon, man.
I had to go home and dribble.
OK.
Call me later if you want to talk about how much fun we had today.
Bobby, have you seen Luanne?
No, she's my cousin!
I'm gonna ride home with Joseph!
Oh, man.
What did she look like?
Come on, come on.
I don't want to think about it.
She's got big boobs, doesn't she?
Yes!
I knew it.
Luan is practically my sister.
I'm not supposed to see her in that state of affairs.
I just got to get that picture out of my head.
Put it in my head.
Tell me everything.
Was she wearing high heels?
She wasn't wearing anything.
Oh, man.
I'm going to picture her in high heels.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey Bobby, uh, I thought we could walk to school together today?
We walk to school together every day.
And we don't leave for another 20 minutes.
I can't go back home.
My dad already armed the perimeter.
Yeah, man.
What you lookin' at, man?
Hey, what you doin'?
Man, I'm talkin' that bad way, man.
Let's go dealin' with those little flip flops, man.
Don't walk across the street like a dang ol' hot coals, man.
Don't dealin' with dogs barkin' like a dang ol' dead chicken with them brothers.
Just head cut off, man.
Head cut off.
Ooh.
So I'm walking to my truck and bam, right into a spiderweb.
I sneezed for a half an hour.
My class was canceled and the library was closed.
I love college.
Hey Bobby, I thought I'd come over and help you with your math homework.
We're kind of in the middle of dinner right now.
I'll wait.
Hey, who am I?
Yeah, hi.
Patient exhibiting classic signs of schizophrenia.
I've wake up in the sunburn, I like to downbang him where I am.
I ain't believe a threat to himself and others.
Recommendation, 72 hour involuntary commitment.
Oh, dang.
Okay, boomer, you win.
I promise not to tell Hank what.
You're where?
The booby hatch.
Wait, the gentleman's club or the mental hospital?
Oh my God!
There must have been some kind of misunderstanding.
Oh, there was.
I'll be right there.
Oh, come on, where you going?
I'm not leaving without my kiss.
I can wait.
I can destroy you.
Mrs. Johnson's bag has six puppies, and Mr. Peterson's bag has minus four puppies.
Good night, Uncle Hank and Peggy.
She's going to bed.
Maybe I could see her naked when she's changing.
I wish you could get that excited about my math homework.
Going to bed, Luanne?
Nope.
First, I gotta shower.
Joseph, my parents are right down the hall.
Why don't your doors have keyholes?
You're really starting to creep me out.
Now go home!
Bobby, it's perfectly natural to want to see a woman naked, but I am your cousin.
Now, the first time was an accident, but if I catch you again, you are going to hell.
Are you crazy?
We're gonna get caught.
I could go to hell.
I can't help myself.
I got a monkey on my back and it wants to see Luann naked.
Okay, one quick look and then you go home.
I can't see anything.
It's all fogged up.
Too bad.
She likes hot showers.
Does she?
Gimme those!
Joseph?
Uh-oh.
Bobby?
Bobby?
Hey, Connie.
How dare you, Bobby.
Peeping at me is bad enough, but bringing your friend over to scope me out too.
Connie, please, you don't... Is this what you're looking for?
Is this what you came to see?
Well, take a good look, you pervs.
You disgust me.
Honest, Connie.
We weren't looking at you.
We were looking at... Birds.
Birds.
Joseph and I were looking at birds.
We were bird-watching.
At night?
You know a better time to see an owl?
Or...
Uh, Bat, uh, uh, Bat.
You're not only a pervert, you're a liar.
I'm a liar.
Have you told your parents we're dating like you said you would?
No.
And maybe now I don't have to.
Maybe you don't.
Maybe I don't.
Oops.
Hey, look.
Okay, smoking breaks over.
Last one inside loses internet privileges.
Hey, you, crazy guy.
I'll give you a smoke if you trade clothes with me.
Boom, Howard.
Man, it ain't about time, Gribble.
Man, you don't get on hitting the road, man.
Infiltration of mental hospital complete.
Proceed to phase two.
Ex-filtration of mental hospital.
Apparently this door has some sort of anti-opening device.
I don't remember my locker combination.
Connie keeps track of that kind of stuff.
She's still icing me out, trying to get me to crack.
You can't tell her the truth.
What are you gonna say?
You let me cop a look at your naked cousin?
Hey, Connie.
Bobby.
Come on, baby.
Don't be that way.
Why don't you come over tonight?
I got a new laser pointer.
Sorry, Bobby.
I have plans.
No, wait.
I'm not sorry.
Which is why so many people are suddenly allergic to peanuts.
Peanuts are emitting toxins as an evolutionary defense mechanism.
They're tired of being eaten, and now they're fighting back.
I see.
Anywho, I just stopped by to pick up my buddy Boomhauer.
You see, we're both in here by mistake.
Now I can't vouch for Boomhauer, but I am most definitely not crazy.
Go on.
Did you just say go, mom?
Now who's the crazy one?
Did you drive down them, you're not crazy?
No.
I don't see any reason why Hank has to know.
Can I tell Boomerower?
No.
OK, I'll be right there.
You are much more beautiful than your picture led me to believe.
What picture?
I sent him pictures, so what?
Go have great time.
Jane, maybe we can sit in the back seat and hold hands.
Now, I know this is going to sound crazy.
Pardon me.
Insane.
But two of my best friends have been accidentally committed to this nut house.
I'll get the doctor on call.
Just don't let anyone touch my scissors.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Oh, man, I can't take it anymore.
I'm talking about I don't want crazy roommate man.
It's time to get my little dang swallow my dang tongue, man.
Hold that thought.
I think I hear Bill.
It's just that in the alley, no one cares what I have to say, but here I feel heard and accepted and there I say, loved.
Ping pong.
Yo.
Have a nice time.
Bobby?
Did he win that for you at the carnival?
No, um, Chane collects them, but, uh, otherwise he's the man of my dreams and I'm going to marry him.
You can't.
Why not?
Oh, all right.
We weren't bird watching.
We were peeping.
Now call off the wind.
Well, thank you for finally telling the truth.
Yeah, but we weren't peeping at you.
I accidentally saw Luann naked at the river and I told Joseph and he got jealous cause he's in love with her so then he wanted to see her naked and I said okay but just for a little and then you caught us.
So you weren't peeping at me?
You gotta believe me Connie, I would never peep at you.
Never ever.
Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
I mean, who would want to look at me when they could look at her?
I would.
Not through a window or anything, but in the same room together.
I mean, you are my girlfriend, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, that's what boyfriends and girlfriends do.
They take off their clothes and then they look at each other naked.
I guess.
Sure they do.
I mean, don't you want to see me naked?
Okay.
Oh, really?
Well, if you don't want to... No, it's...tell you what.
Um, maybe we could just start with our shirts.
You know, what's the rush?
We got our whole lives ahead of us.
Okay.
You first.
Okay.
You've got a pretty body.
Thank you.
Here goes.
So how is it with chain wa-wa-wa-wa?
Come, what's going- ya-ya!
Oh my.
Repeat after me.
Bobby Hill is not your boyfriend.
Chain Wasana Song is your boyfriend.
No, he's not.
Chain Wasana Song is your boyfriend.
Mom, we had one date.
I don't even like- Chain Wasana Song!
Chain Wasana Song is a boring know-it-all who only talks about himself and cheats at miniature golf.
I don't want to date him.
I want to date Bobby.
Wow!
You think that boy have future?
That not baby fat.
That permanent.
Con Junior, you leave me no choice.
You are grounded.
And Bobby Hill is not allowed on my property.
First you caught a look at Luan.
Then you see Connie naked?
Man, when did you become such a player?
I didn't see Connie naked.
I only saw her belly button.
How was it?
Incredible!
But I'll never see it again.
Connie's grounded, and when my dad hears about this, he's gonna ground me too.
You'll be stuck in the house all day with Luan?
Mm, mm, mm.
We gotta get outta here.
Smoking breaks are too short, the food is good at best, and the antidepressants are making my mouth dry and happy.
Can I get some glitter, please?
Why don't we just call Hank?
No.
Hank must never know we were in here.
Our society stigmatizes the mentally ill.
And rightly so, these people are nuts.
We're ever gonna bust out of here.
We'll need our wits about us.
So from now on, no more taking pills.
We're gonna save them up and then sell them to the guards.
And with that money, we'll buy a rope.
Well, man, you're talking about a little stupid plan.
We're never gonna work this.
Oh, really?
You have a better idea?
Well, yeah, man.
I tell you what, man.
About every day, about on 215, man.
I mean, a little laundry truck, man, coming on them cover break, man.
All we do is end up with nothing to it, man.
That is the worst plan I have ever heard.
But this is a democracy, so we'll put it to a vote.
All in favor of boom hours plan.
I must admit, I'm surprised by the results.
I figured I had at least my support.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Hey, Conn.
I thought I heard someone mixing concrete.
Oh, that's right.
I'm building fence.
Big fence.
Eight feet tall.
Between your house and my house.
Eight feet, huh?
Yeah.
You see, Con, in this neighborhood, side fences have to be five foot six or under.
It's not in the code or anything.
It's just something I'm trying to enforce.
You really want to help me, Hank Hill?
You keep your dirty little boys' hands off my innocent, genius daughter.
Now, what's that supposed to mean?
Last night, I catch Bobby half naked in Connie's room.
Bobby?
Truth about your little boy not so pretty after all, is it, Hank Hill?
He girl crazy sex fiend.
Well, that boy's gonna get a talking to, I tell you what.
Phew.
Okay, man.
Come on.
Move, move, move.
How did they find out about this?
I might have mentioned something in group.
First one to regain consciousness calls Hank.
All right, I just spoke with your doctor.
Boomhauer, you were kept for the mandatory 72 hours, and since you don't seem to be a threat to yourself or others, you're free to go.
All right, man.
I don't want to hank, man.
Dale, you were never actually admitted, so you're also free to go.
But the doctor thinks that you should keep on taking your medication.
Easier to swallow.
And Bill, the doctor says that since you checked yourself involuntarily, you can leave whenever you want.
Yeah, I know, but I think I'll stay a few more days.
I'm making some real progress here.
Bill, just get in the truck.
No!
I learned in group that I sacrifice my feelings too easily.
My feelings are valid, Hank.
I'm valid.
Oh, I made this for you.
You will call Chenwa Sana Song and apologize for not calling sooner.
Here, I wrote out Laotian Chit Chat for you.
Make sure you use honorific verb form.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Not many Laotian boys in Ireland.
Don't piss this away!
Go ahead.
Try to sneak into my daughter's room now.
Stupid redneck.
Bobby!
Bobby!
Connie!
Come down here!
I miss you.
I can't move or I'll set off my dad's security light.
Don't move!
Ted, what are you doing here?
I was just getting the guys out of the insane asylum.
What are you doing here?
The, uh, ten footer ought to do it.
The middle one.
Hurry, Bobby.
I know a couple of those words.
I better go.
Bye.
I see you.
Can't see everything.
You know you're not too big to be spanked, you dirty little hillbilly.
At Paggy, Mr. Khan saw me naked.
Oh man.
Did you just say go mom?
