Now, I've cleared a space 12 by 8 by 14 to hide Bobby's Christmas present, so when we're at the store, keep an eye out for a gift that size.
Last Christmas, I hid Joseph's gift so well I still haven't found it.
Cutest little puppy.
Or should I say dog?
Yeah, nothing like the face of a child on Christmas morning.
What's it like?
It's the single greatest thing on earth.
That is, except for all the hundreds of special moments that any dad shares with his child.
Sounds nice.
Well, I guess I'll just go home all by myself and eat a pot pie.
Today's turkey.
See ya!
Hey Bill, you know I've got some errands to run today.
Go into the post office.
Why don't you come along?
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
You can take a $5 bill and put it in the change machine.
Pretend you're in Las Vegas.
Ka-ching.
Whoo!
Look at all that mail.
I haven't gotten so much as a letter in six weeks.
Well, it's a busy time of year.
They're probably just backed up, or maybe they lost it.
Yeah, you're right.
My name is Bill Dothrieff, and apparently you have lost my mail.
I'll check in the back.
Uh, look, about my friend's lost male, you're not gonna find it.
I know that.
We just walked to the back for show.
You know, you may want to check William Dothrieve, too.
Bill is short for William.
If you want mail, we've got these bags in the corner.
Those are letters addressed to Santa Claus.
You know, we're always looking for volunteers to take one or two and buy a gift to make a needy kid happy.
Well, what a great idea.
I think I'll take one myself.
How about you, Bill?
You'd make a great Santa.
And that's not a fat joke.
You really think so?
This guy seems a little off.
Bill's great with kids.
It's adults and holidays he seems to have a problem with.
Has anyone seen where I put my scotch tape?
Did you check under my chin?
You know, you fall for Dale's beard of tape every year, Peggy.
Yes, yes, I do.
And I'm always a good sport about it.
My first wrapping party.
Ow!
I just cut my finger.
Deep.
Well, it doesn't compare to the pain of previous years when I didn't have any kids to wrap for.
Matthew said he likes music, so I got him a trombone.
I can't wait to see the expression on his face.
You don't give the gifts yourself.
You buy them, you wrap them, then we mail them and put the return address as North Paul.
Oh.
Does the mailman at least dress as Santa?
No.
He does, and every kid should get to see Santa.
Oh my god.
It's snowing.
It's snowing!
What the?
You know, Peggy, it is snowing.
That is not snow.
It's 64 degrees.
Well, that is the foam that they spray on runways when jumbo jets are about to crash.
Bobby!
Get in here!
Now, are you going to open this before Christmas?
No, sir.
Good.
You're a very good boy.
Open it, open it.
The kids haven't had a real Christmas since their father left.
Can I pay you for these things?
What would Santa need money for?
My elves make all the toys.
I mean, ho, ho, ho.
rented snow machines, all these lights, looks like a carnival.
I wonder how Jesus feels about this.
It's Christmas and Bill's happy.
I'll tell you how Jesus feels.
Great.
Hey, this is perfect.
Tomorrow Christmas service falls right between the Aloha Bowl and the Oahu Bowl.
And we can top the whole day off with the Christmas Smackdown.
Christmas smackdown.
Here it is.
Hey, Dennis Rodman is going to be a guest referee.
Boy, you know that guy's catching a folding chair to the head.
The worm.
Oh, wait a second.
Sorry, Bobby.
It's rated TV 14.
The last time I checked, you were still 13.
Oh, come on, Dad.
I tell you what.
I'll just close my eyes when things get too colorful.
Nice try, mister, but I've seen the way you watch TV.
You never blink.
Oh, oh, oh, Merry Christmas!
Better honk, dad.
It won't feel like Christmas Day if we miss the little drummer boy.
I'm doing the best I can.
Wait a minute, you're being sarcastic.
You don't have any interest in seeing that little boy play his heart out, do you?
Ballet parking is five dollars.
Ballet of the Dales is not responsible for lost or stolen artichoke.
Dale, I'm just gonna park in my driveway.
That lot's full, but Bill says I can put overflow park and poolside at Luan's house.
Octavio!
La Bamba, Leiautomo, Bilo!
No scratcho!
Comprende!
Out of the way!
Hey!
You're back!
Oh, I have got to find some way to thank you for everything.
DeSanta like chicken.
Fried dirt broiler boil.
Well, after the holidays, I'm going to cook you a homemade chicken dinner.
And will you eat it with me, too?
Oh, Bill, I could just wrap you up.
Oh, oh, oh!
And she made the date with him?
Yep.
They're gonna have chicken.
Well, I suppose we can suffer through this racket if it means Bill will be spending time with a woman who knows he's there.
Yeah, and it's just till New Year's, then it all comes down.
Mm-hmm.
You know what?
We can just pretend that all that noise is the ocean.
Yes, it's working.
Looks like it's gonna be a great new year.
Notre Dame lost, Bill had a great Christmas and now he's taken down his decorations instead of trying to hang himself with him.
Looks like he hired professionals or very dedicated amateurs.
Huh.
What the?
They start the Christmas season earlier and earlier each year.
No!
Hey guys, take off your shoes, come on in!
I tell you January's the month to rent a Santa bounce house.
I got a hell of a deal.
Come on, how about taking all this down?
Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea, I'll help.
No, no, no, I can't take down Santa's village.
You see how happy those kids are?
Well, they do like jumping.
Yeah, and someone I have a lot of respect for once told me that Christmas is about giving and love.
Yeah, we all got Boom Hire's Christmas card, too.
Last month, in December.
Hank, there'll be plenty of time for these kids to be beaten down by life.
But if I can help bring a little extra joy and love into their worlds now, sure not.
Why do you hate love, Hank?
Hi!
Hiya!
Well, so much for my New Year's resolution.
Who says a mustache has to go across the whole lip?
Ho, ho, ho!
Happy Martin Luther King, Jr.
Day!
Why don't you kids celebrate by taking a spin in my bounce house?
Have you been talking to my dad?
Well, guess what?
We're not little kids.
We don't jump in bouncy houses.
You're right on time.
Oh, you're still doing this.
Yeah, just around the house.
They won't let me on the army base like this anymore.
So, where are the kids?
Sam and Emma, right?
I got a babysitter.
I thought we might... Hey, mind if I knock off early?
I don't think any kids are coming by today.
Oh, okay.
See you tomorrow morning, nine sharp.
That's the Arlen midget.
He comes with the bounce house.
Shall we?
You know, why don't you enjoy the chicken?
You can just keep the dish.
Yeah, but you and the kids are still coming over Sunday night for haircut, right?
I like their hair long.
You should've used cold water.
Yeah, but that doesn't get enough of the stains out.
Hi, I'm the Milton Street Santa.
I'm Wally.
Hey Santa, can you lend me two bucks?
For the dryer?
Sure, which one's yours?
Oh, I got him soaking in a place a few blocks away, but nobody there had the Christmas spirit if you know what I mean.
No, of course I do.
I got a lot of blue jeans in there.
You ever wear wet blue jeans?
Man, this is the best Christmas ever.
Bill, why don't you take Marilyn out someplace nice for Valentine's Day?
Women like Valentine's Day.
They find it romantic.
Marilyn's gone.
Of course she is.
You know, Bill, even Troy Aikman takes off his uniform after the Super Bowl.
How do you know?
Dude, do that outside.
Sam?
Emma?
Hey, Santa!
Remember me?
It's Wally, the little boy from the laundromat.
What are you doing here?
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
I told my buddies how cool you were and they all had to meet you.
Yeah, can we have some money?
He means candy canes.
I'm out of canes, but I still have ten pounds of rice crispy treat shaped like reindeer.
What the... Ah, now who... Heineken?
Nice pool.
What say we jump in?
See what floats.
Just keep your beer cans off of my lawns.
And quit trying to read my t-shirts!
You lose something over here?
I am making a citizen's arrest for trespassing.
I don't think so.
Believe me, I've done it before.
Well, how did you get Bill's key chain?
Okay, you're under arrest for theft too.
He gave it to me.
Now get off our property or our citizen will arrest you.
Damn it, when Bill comes home, when boo go hoo, what the hell are you doing?
What the hoo did you do?
The thing is, I did something today.
What is it, Wally?
I bought you a gift.
It's a belt, Sander.
There's something else.
What?
You can tell me.
You can tell me anything.
I kinda lied to the guy at the hardware store.
I told him I was getting this from my dad.
Here.
Oh!
You could make a Japanese rock garden where that tire mark is.
I know a Japanese guy who might have some rocks.
Oh, hey guys, we're just at the grocery store and Wally did the cutest thing.
What'd he do?
Did he ride a unicycle?
Did he juggle?
Did he find an adorable way to peel out on my lawn?
No, Hank, I'm not saying my Wally isn't a handful, but I like a kid with spirit.
And as for your lawn, it's my responsibility, and I will re-sod the damaged area.
Fair enough?
Fair enough.
He blocked the channel guard.
Now I don't even know what I'm missing.
My dad is pushing every one of my buttons.
I believe you guys are first-time callers, so I'm only gonna charge you a buck.
For what?
Beer.
We better go.
Why?
Because beer's not TV 14.
Sit me up, my man.
What's the matter?
40 ounces for a buck's a good deal.
Oh, yeah.
I just usually drink 30 ounces, but hey, it's the weekend.
Come here.
Just St.
County, girl.
When we're grown-ups and married, we'll get to do this every night.
Yeah, I want a house just like this, with soft floors and plastic windows.
Look at the stars.
There's... so many of them.
Yeah, cool.
You know the best way to sober up?
Bounce around a lot.
Get it out of your system.
Bobby?
Hey, Dad!
I like beer!
You, you, and you!
Go home now!
You get the hell out of here!
That doesn't.
I've had about enough of this Christmas crap.
Bill!
Dang it, Bill.
Some of us are trying to raise kids in this neighborhood.
Good kids.
The kind that don't try to kill their parents in their sleep.
Kids like Bobby.
Wally would never kill me.
He told me so.
And that kind of communication is very important in a father-son style relationship.
What?
Is that my belt, Sander?
No, it's mine.
Wally bought it and gave it to me as a present.
Yeah?
Then why does it have the same serial number as my warranty card?
Uh, I know there are two sides to every story, but Hank was bragging about his new belt sander all last week.
Where do you think I got the idea?
That ape was strutting around showing off his fancy belt sander, and I thought, hey, Bill's a better man than this ass.
He should have a belt sander.
So I bought you one.
Yes, just, you know, Hank had the warranty card.
So this is how it's gonna be.
Hank good, Wally bad.
I'm not saying that, but maybe it wasn't such a good idea given, well, selling beer to kids.
Wow.
You really are like my dad.
Really?
Yeah.
He never had faith in me either.
But at least he had a motorcycle.
Wally, building a strong relationship ain't easy.
We can work through this.
I don't like work.
I did ten sit-ups and I tried to do a push-up.
Can I go back to sleep now?
You had a chance to sleep last night, mister, but you decided to go partying instead.
Now get a rag and start washing windows.
I almost hated waking him this morning.
But then he tried to tell me that his hangover was punishment enough, so I flipped him off his mattress.
And it's all your fault.
You broke my family.
Wally was not your family.
My God, I've thrown out propane tanks that would make a better son than Wally.
But he's all ahead!
Oh, poor Bill.
He probably shouldn't be alone.
But he will be.
Wait!
I've got it!
Bill wants to have a child.
And Hank's urethra is too narrow to have another child.
Ergo, Bill should inseminate Peggy.
Everybody's happy.
Ow!
Didn't hurt!
Nancy!
What?
Huh?
Where are you?
I got a call from Wally.
Where is he?
Jail?
Yes!
Some trumped up charge.
He can't survive in jail.
You've got to help me bail him out.
No way.
Things got out of hand in the first place because you didn't lay down the law with Wally.
Oh, please.
You were right.
I don't know how to be a father.
All the books about it are by comedians, and I never know when they're kidding and when they're serious.
Oh, please.
I need you to go with me.
No.
You do everything right, but if you didn't, I'd be there for you.
And could you drive?
Wally still hadn't returned my car.
The car was crammed with cartons of cigarettes, packs of jerky, lotters, all your big ticket impulse items.
He says you okayed the use of the credit card and the use of the automobile.
Is that true?
The jerky was for you?
Hank, what should I do?
Well, I'd lock him up for what we know he did and then toss on a few extra years for what he probably did.
Yeah, but if I lock him up, he won't like me.
But if I bail him out, he'll just keep stealing my money and I won't like him.
Parenting's tough.
Try having my job with a kid in jail.
That gets weird.
You know what would be cool?
If you left it a little longer in the back, it would be like our little bond.
I'd thank you.
Sorry, no can do.
You may not be happy with me now, soldier, but you'll thank me someday.
For what?
For making me a jarhead?
No, for convincing the judge that the army is a better place for you than prison.
Oh, and you're not a jarhead.
That's the Marine Corps.
You're a grunt!
Bobby, if you get caught drinking again, it's gonna be your button this chair.
Make that right, Hank.
Sure is.
Now, let's shave that thing off of Wally's chin.
Valley of the Dales is not responsible for lost or stolen articles.
