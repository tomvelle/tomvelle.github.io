I thought of a new game this morning.
A pancake fell on the floor, so I closed my eyes and put it back on one of our plates.
Now I don't know whose plate.
I call it pancake roulette.
I'm gonna triple jump this monkey.
Could someone put pancake in my eye?
Bobby, I told you no video games at the table.
I know, but this is homework.
It's my assignment for PE class.
I know I should have done it last night, but I was watching TV.
Wait, they're letting you play video games in PE?
Yeah, it's for people who don't want to exercise.
It's the active electronic lifestyle option.
Well, that's asinine.
PE is supposed to be about sports.
They make video games for lots of sports.
Football, baseball, golf.
My thumbs are gonna be huge.
Getting the truck.
This really isn't a good time to put me back in PE.
They're making everybody take the Presidential Fitness Test.
Bobby, when the President asks you to take a test, you take the test.
But they make you take it in front of everybody, and they measure your body fat with calipers.
Calipers!
Now don't worry, Bobby.
I'll help you train.
It'll be great.
We'll set goals, design a program, and chart your progress.
What are you doing here?
I thought all the do-it-kids were going to take the easy way out.
No offense, Hike.
Well, you call them like you see them, Coach.
But that's why Bobby is here.
He's taking the Presidential Fitness Test.
Son, take your place in line and do whatever Coach Clehammer screams.
What the heck is going on, Carl?
I know the divorce hadn't been easy, but that's no reason to take it out on PE.
The school board wants more computers in the classroom, and they said this counts.
You gotta understand my position, Hank.
I can't believe you are spending our tax dollars on low-rider rampage.
We're not spending a penny.
It's a new program in conjunction with Community College.
Their kids design the games, and our kids test them.
Could be worse.
There's a school in Houston that sits around watching kung fu movies all day.
But playing video games isn't the same as doing a pull-up.
These kids should be outside.
Especially that one.
Hey, student Hank.
That's one of our student teachers.
About time you got here.
Boy's bathroom stinks, dude.
What?
I'm not the janitor.
And you need to show some respect.
Hey, that's a sweet hat.
Would you get it, Urban Outfitters?
I got it at work.
Oh.
Do you work at Urban Outfitters?
No, I work at Strickland Propane.
It's not ironic?
You're got dang right it's not.
How in the hell can a hat be ironic?
Check out how aggro this guy is.
Dang, I just got shot in the face.
Come on.
The president's fitness test demands total focus.
Those that pass will get a certificate printed with a version of the president's signature.
Those who do not pass will get a magnet, a blank magnet.
Strictly propane tastes the meat, not the heat.
Well, most people put ketchup or mustard on it.
No, I wouldn't recommend both.
Don't touch that.
What are you people doing here anyway?
I don't know.
You got us curious about propane.
Check it out.
Propane's a liquid and a gas.
I know that.
I've been stocking that pamphlet since before you were born.
Hey dude, how do we get one of those hats?
by dedicating your life to propane.
You're not qualified to wear one of these.
What if someone came up to you with the leaky propane tank and all you could do is stand there and say, duh, I don't know, I'm just wearing the hat.
Leaky propane tank.
I think he's about to take a swing at us.
Awesome.
Leave.
Well, I'm glad I got you out of that video game class, Bobby.
Those teachers are a couple of jiblet heads.
Isn't this better?
Pain leading to gain?
Yeah, this is just great.
Look, what the heck is Hank here making?
Maybe he's going to hang up Gribble and beat him until Candy comes out.
No, if Gribble had Candy inside him, Bobby here would have found it already.
Standing long jump.
Now when I say go, jump as far as you can.
Swing your arms, and go!
Really?
Uh, well, okay, son.
Good effort.
Good effort.
Hey dudes, video game P.E.
's harder than I thought.
Do you think you could help me with my homework?
Sorry, Joseph.
I gotta jump.
The new game my teacher made is about propane.
Well, that figure's... those two idiots spelled it wrong.
Wait a second.
This looks like Strickland propane.
See?
I can't move my bobtail!
Try pressing the red button.
Oh my god.
Dad!
It's you!
Cool!
I tell you what.
So, wait, when you play this game, you get to be Hank?
That sounds interesting.
It's not interesting, it's thievery.
You can't just take someone's face without asking.
Thank you!
This is crazy.
Those idiot gamers have put features of the Char-King onto the Flame Master.
This won't stand.
We have to do something.
They're exploiting my business for financial gain.
Potentially huge, incredible financial gain.
Catalog every mention of stricken propane and other verbiage for which I own or intend to own a copyright.
Yes, sir.
Roger's already getting me familiar with the game.
I think I got all the points I can in here.
Let's go outside.
Oh my god, you just punched that motorist.
I needed a vehicle.
This is horrible.
Hold on a second.
I'm gonna engage these guys.
Engage?
Well, that's the basics.
I got delivery to make.
Remember, cops are bad.
Oh, God, I just stabbed a parking attendant.
Where's the button to turn myself in?
Well, Hank, as you can see, pretty much nothing happens when you're not here.
Sorry, Bobby.
I can't train you right now.
I've got some work to do for Mr. Strickland.
I'll help you, Bobby.
All right, let's see what you got.
Jump over the bar!
Uh, actually, Dale, I need your help with the video game.
Bobby, I'll be right back.
Go ahead and get started.
I thought my dad knew me better.
I am not a self-motivator.
I'm not doing anything.
I could help you until your dad comes back.
Try kicking your legs.
Watch and learn.
I'm going to teach you a technique I call brain hand.
It involves me mentally shutting off my brain and then moving it into my hands.
Oh, come on.
If you threw a propane tank at a car, neither one of them would explode.
Dale, make Hank wave back at me.
My turn.
I'm next.
Where do I find Peggy?
but I barely got to be Hank at all.
Okay, that's enough messing around.
I'm on official Strickland business.
A manager mode, huh?
I didn't notice that before.
That's kind of interesting.
Wow, North Ireland's changed.
There sure are a lot of check cashing places.
Oh, look at that pretty lady taking her little baby for a walk.
Oh, no.
Get him, Hank, before he gets away!
Huh?
Okay.
Well, this bobtail handles nicely.
Hurry, Hank!
Hurry!
Don't chase him!
Shoot him in the back!
That's not how I do things.
You did it!
Hey, maybe this game doesn't have to be about the mayhem.
You'll never rob a mini-mart again, Buster.
You've been promoted to Senior Manager.
Oh my god, what's next?
Regional Manager?
God dang pamphlet.
Excuse me, I'm looking to upgrade my grill.
Well, propane is ideal for both home and business.
Uh, okay.
Well, bad news, old top.
No need for us to fool around with this game anymore.
What?
Why?
Well, there's no money in it.
Lawyer says it's in the public domain.
But there are three more levels I haven't even seen yet.
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna make any money off it, so quit playing and get back to work.
Okay.
Grab the bar, you scissified piece of lady snot!
That's what my coach always says.
Go, go, go!
Almost there!
Bobby, you got off the ground.
What was it?
Printer paper?
No, construction.
This is why my dad hasn't been around.
He wanted me to gut it out.
And I did!
Alright, drop and give me one!
You pathetic little cockroach!
Give me a push-up!
Now, now, now!
Cockroaches did a push-up!
Cockroaches did a push-up!
I gotta go tell my dad!
Mom, I did a push-up a real-life push-up.
Not a lady one either.
I gave 110% and I gotta go tell Dad.
My face was on the ground, and then I started pushing.
And then, when I opened my eyes, the ground was moving away from my face.
Uh-huh.
Wanna see me do a push-up without bending my knees?
One more punk, and I am regional manager.
I think your father would love to see you do a push-up.
Right, Hank?
Hmm.
Well, that's a thinker.
It sure is.
I'm gonna go hit the showers.
Well, that's the way you manage a region.
Why'd you do that?
To be dramatic.
Well, quick, if you plug it back in, it might start wearing a left off.
A woman knows when her husband has an addiction, Hank.
A woman who reads Parade Magazine knows.
What?
No, you're overreacting.
Emma, you have any idea how your son's doing?
Or the lawn?
Nothing's wrong with the lawn.
Hank, there's a brown spot.
And there's also a brown spot on your son.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm lunging!
I'm feeling the burn!
Was Bobby just doing lunges?
Oh my god, you're right.
I didn't realize killing a man with my bare thumbs would change me so much.
I'll quit.
Prove it.
Trash that controller.
Ask Marilyn says that people who own fancy electronics are called techno-sexuals.
Take it.
Okay, let's go.
Grab your feet.
Come on, grab them.
Good try.
A for effort.
Nice work.
Alright, break time.
Bobby, go get your Game Boy.
What?
Your Game Boy.
Go get it.
Is this a trick?
Yes, it was.
And, uh, and you passed.
And for your reward, go get your Game Boy.
Ha ha, dad!
Nice try!
It's good to have you back, Hank.
I figured out how to drink my beer through osmosis.
Yeah, the game was way too easy anyway.
The designers could have bumped it up a notch.
I still enjoy it.
I found some folks on the internet who play against each other online.
You can do that?
Yeah, I'm not very good.
There are too many hanks on the screen.
I never know which one to listen to.
I didn't know playing online was even an option.
There's a smudge on my glasses.
Excuse me.
I'm so buzzed.
Don't judge me, Lady Bird.
No, no, not my pimp's cup.
How could you hike?
All right.
How about this?
I'll only play one night a week after work.
I won't even watch TV.
No.
What about you?
You have hobbies.
You play boggle.
Let's talk about that.
You will not turn this around on me.
I married a man, Hank.
Not a gamer.
Carl I need to find those game quote unquote teachers sorry Peggy video game programs been canceled bunch of parents found out their kids were playing video games started something called an action group scared the hell out of the district I need to find them Carl I have a question about their game well you can probably rule out any place with girls wrong get get on back to PE
Body horror makes classic horror look like Euro horror.
Wait, what's body horror?
Why are we even friends?
Oh, thank God I found you.
My husband Hank is addicted to your propane game.
I need your help to get him to stop.
Well, don't worry.
It'll fall out of style.
Only like six people still play it.
Yeah, things don't fall out of style for Hank.
There's only two things that will stop a gamer from gaming.
Boredom or humiliation, though 2% stop because of seizures.
Hank is incapable of boredom or seizures.
But humiliation... What Hank died.
Dude, I got propane.
Hey everybody, I'm Hank Hill, driving home to have a hot meal with my wife and my son, whom I love so much.
Yes.
What?
I killed everyone.
You?
Well that's first-timers luck.
You won't get me again.
Why won't you die?
I am invincible.
That's cheating.
Tell me how.
The programmers who made the game put me in Commissioner mode.
What?
There is no one above me and I cannot be killed.
And once this Commissioner explodes itself, that is the end of the game.
Forever.
No, no, no!
Can I try Commissioner mode please?
Just 15 minutes.
Don't do it, don't do it.
Well, thank you, Peggy.
Feels good to blink.
Way to go, Bobby.
Good job, Hill.
You need two more to pass.
Sorry, Coach.
That's all I got.
Take your bag net.
Okay, next stop.
Tell me when to squeeze.
I don't deserve it.
What are you talking about?
You did great.
Why?
I failed.
I'm not getting the President's Fitness Award.
Bobby, turn around.
You did one more pull-up than all these other kids.
Yeah, you're right.
And we'll start training for next year right now.
Great, Dad.
Do you think I should shave off my body hair to be more aerodynamic next time?
No Bobby, I don't.
Taste the meat and the heat.
