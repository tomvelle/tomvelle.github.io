Sir, I'm very sorry we shorted you on your propane delivery.
Even though this was the new gal's mistake, I'll be noting it on my own record as well.
I'll be right out there.
Hank, let's go to lunch.
I have been craving cheese all morning.
Sorry, I can't take you to lunch today.
That new gal buck hired?
Well, long story short, she's dumb as a charcoal briquette.
Yo, dude.
Uh, I might must something else up.
This dude called and he's talking so fast.
Propane this, something, guess that.
I was like, whoa.
Dang, I am such as bad.
Tammy, this is my wife, Peggy.
Peggy, this is our new customer service associate, Tammy.
You know, you look a lot like the last girl Buck hired.
Of course she's dead now.
We'll have lunch another time, maybe tonight.
You know, if you've got no one else to have lunch with, I'll go with you.
I mean, only if you want to.
Oh, no, I'm just trying to think if there's anything else I need to do.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, shall we?
I'll get my hairspray.
What do you order here?
This menu is totally whack.
Personally, I like the La Creep Suzette.
Get out, you talk French.
Oh, Pockito.
Actually, I am a substitute Espanol teacher.
That is so slammin'.
Well, when you think about it, I suppose it is slammin'.
Your parents must be psyched.
No, uh-uh.
I could be queen of Egypt and my mother wouldn't give a hoot.
Wow.
Well, I really know that trip.
My mom and I hadn't talked since I dropped out of school.
Maybe it was since I totaled her vet.
Your mother drove a Corvette?
She'll vet.
You would not have dropped out of school on Peggy Hill's watch.
I make learning fun, incredibly fun.
Well, that's why I moved here from Oklahoma City.
Yo, I just wanted to start over, you know, maybe get my GED.
Dang, I'm thirsty.
Hey Pierre, how about a couple of dye coats?
Pierre, well look who's talking French now.
The Thai food was Tammy's idea.
The notion of taking it out was mine.
Next Sunday, I would like to travel to Taravia and see those pyramids.
So Luanne, you go to community college?
That is awesome.
I am totally impressed.
I've never even finished a whole book.
Well, that's just because you've never had the right tutor.
If Helen Keller can graduate from college, you can certainly get your GED.
My G freakin' ED?
Your learning adventure begins tomorrow after work at your place.
If you have cats, please vacuum.
My place?
Actually, I kind of got kicked out of my apartment last night, so I'm living out the car.
But we can meet at Starbucks.
Could I use the phone in your bedroom?
It's long distance, but I'll pay you back.
Could you?
Or can you?
You may.
Hank, we are not letting Tammy sleep in her car.
Let's give her the den till she gets back on her feet.
Not my den.
No way.
It took me two years to get this one out of there.
If Boomhauer got kicked out of his house, you would let him stay in the den.
Yes, but Boomhauer is a family friend.
Plus, he's immaculate.
Tammy!
Hank and I just discussed it, and I insist that you stay with us until you find a new place.
What?
But... You guys are the raddest.
This calls for a celebration!
I'm staying up till 11!
My dad's taking the truck to a swap meet this weekend, so I better take scratch and ding inventory now.
Hang on a sec!
That Tammy's quite a dish.
Frankly though, I think my Nancy has a nicer can.
Hank, do you think Nancy has a nicer can than Tammy's can?
Huh?
My wife's can, vis-a-vis your wife's friend's can?
Stop it, Dale.
It's about enough I have to live with her now.
Running around the house knows many skirts.
That pager never stops beeping, and I've had it up to here with her coming in all hours of the night.
How do my girls look, Hank?
Uh, I wouldn't know.
Well, where are you off to all jazzed up like that?
Uh, I'm just going to hang out with a friend.
Oh, another friend.
I'm sorry, I thought I was your friend.
Who was this other friend?
Oh, uh, yeah, he's an old bud from Oklahoma City.
You know, passing through town on business.
Maybe your old bud would like to meet your new bud.
Uh, definitely.
Definitely next time.
Hey, long time no see.
You still charging your Oklahoma City rate?
A hundred bucks a throw up front, like always.
I know a place where we can park.
Boy, Peggy, I don't know.
I'm beginning to suspect that Tammy is a, well, a freeloader.
No, she is not.
If there is one thing I know, Hank, it is people, and Tammy is good people.
See ya!
She took the best piece of ham.
I was saving that for Lady Bird.
Hey everybody, I'm home!
I thought you were going out with your other friend.
Oh, he was just in town for the hour.
Huh, that's odd.
Why would he... Oh, hey, before I forget, this is for you.
It's 50 bucks.
I mean, you guys have been so amazing to me.
It's the least I can do, you know, for using your phone and chowing your food.
That makes the score at Peggy Hill 1, and people who doubt Peggy Hill 0.
Yeah, that bottom paper tray needs to be filled.
It's full.
Well, tap it off.
You know, Tammy, I run a private propane tutorial retreat up my leg house.
If you got a thirst for knowledge and margaritas, I'm free this weekend.
Thanks, Buck, but I'm pretty booked up this weekend.
Most weekends, actually.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Don't get in here.
Boy, I had her all wrong.
It takes a lot of character to stand up to Buck when he turns on that charm.
Oh Hank, Tammy's got more sense than to go after a married man.
Poor kid.
She's probably very lonely and it doesn't help that we're waving our happy marriage in her face all the time.
Hey, why don't I introduce Tammy to some of the single guys on my route?
Maybe she'll meet a nice fella to settle down with.
She is gonna make someone a great wife, but it's gonna have to be someone who can hold her interest.
Her dates never last more than an hour.
Howdy, Hank.
Well, well.
Who's this?
This is Tammy Duvall.
She's new over at Strickland.
Lane Prattley?
Uh, Prattley Cadillac Hyundai?
As in the owner.
Oh, cool.
Nice to meet you.
Well, I'm gonna go check the tank, so feel free to talk while I'm gone.
Fine, fine.
So?
How long you been in town?
I think I also better check the gaskets.
That's fine!
So, how long you been in town?
Dang, official GED practice tests.
Do you really think I can pass?
Please, people who haven't even graduated from high school can do this.
Now, here is the first book you're going to finish.
Congo by Michael Critchton.
This is the kind of book people read on planes.
Now that would look hot on you.
No, I could never wear something that bold.
Why not?
You sure got the legs.
Yo, show them off.
That dress is pretty rad.
We'll hit the makeup counter.
And when I'm through with you, believe me, honey, you are gonna be stopping cars.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Dad.
Them's the keys to my Cadillac car.
Remember, under no circumstances is the wife allowed in my Cadillac car, unless she's in a bag in the trunk.
I know, I know.
Have fun at the swap meet.
I hope you clean the bed liner in your truck.
I don't want no dirt on Hitler's canoe.
Hank, would you mind seeing if that's for me?
I'm not ready yet.
Hell big god dang.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
You ever work Houston?
No.
Vegas?
No.
Tijuana?
No.
Reno?
No.
Oh, hey, Mr. Burton.
Is everything okay with your tanks?
I safety checked them this afternoon.
Oh, uh, right.
Yeah, uh, the tanks are fine.
I'm just here for, uh, you know, Tammy.
We have a date.
Huh.
Well, hold on, uh, I'll go get her.
The Philippines?
No.
Bangkok?
I think I would have remembered you.
Don't be so sure, sweet cheeks.
I've been known to give a girl amnesia.
Dad, please don't bring us back another Japanese skull.
It's just going to gather dust.
Now, Tammy Miles Burton's at the door.
He says he's got a date with you.
What's that about?
Hank, you introduced us.
But I thought you were going out with Lane Prattley tonight.
I am after my date with Miles.
Oh, I see.
Well, nothing wrong with having lots of different suitors.
That's the way dating used to be back in my mom's day.
This is a little present for you because you are so rad.
And this is next week's rent in advance.
You are one class act, I tell you what.
And I have one more surprise for y'all.
Peggy, you ready?
As always.
Presenting the new improved Peggy Hill.
Whoa.
What?
You don't like it?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you look hot.
Well, that's true.
OK, everybody.
I got to fly.
Peace out.
Wonder what she got me.
Well, I kind of like it.
Well, we look like a couple of movie stars.
We sure do, baby.
Yep.
Yep.
All right, if no one's going to say it to you, Hank, I'll say it.
I am jealous of that hat.
Me too.
Hey, man, that ain't gonna smooove old hat, man.
Yeah, I tell you, it's pretty sporty.
I've got a word around to break in the felt.
I don't mean to put you on the spot, Hank, but do you think I'd have a shot with Tammy?
Look, Bill, you're a great guy, but I've set her up with some of the most prominent men in Ireland.
And none of them has been good enough for her to date exclusively.
She's very selective.
Reverend Stroop?
Uh, Hank?
Give me the money.
Donald, let go of me.
Hey, hey, come on.
I mean it.
Hey, don't you ever lay your hands on a lady.
You understand?
OK, OK, OK, OK.
You're ripping the jacket.
Now, what's the problem here?
This hose bag owes me money.
Give her the money, friend.
I'm not going to ask you twice.
OK, but you.
You mess with her, you mess with me.
Now, hand over the money.
OK, all right, OK.
We're cool, okay?
Yeah, we're cool.
Now beat it.
Hank, man, you are the bomb.
Well, from the reaction we're getting, I guess they haven't had two pretty women in this library in a while.
Dude, check out the feet on the one on the left.
It's gotta be a guy.
But there's no Adam's apple.
They can fix that.
I've been with worse.
Mrs. Hill?
Is that you?
Well, hello, Mike.
You must be Mrs. Soto.
Hello.
I am Peggy Hill, Mike's teacher.
You're a teacher?
Why are you dressed like that?
What?
Is there a dress code for teachers now?
Some chicks just hate it when other chicks look hotter.
Story of my life.
Can I help you?
Allow me to introduce myself.
Alabasta Jones, the main Mac Daddy of Oklahoma City.
Ms.
Tammy DeVall works for me.
I am her manager.
Well, she works for me now.
I'm her manager, technically assistant manager.
It ain't like that, G. I am her pimp.
Pimp, you must have her confused with somebody else.
The Tammy Duvall I know works at Strickland Propane.
Man, don't be giving me no nut roll.
I ain't no chilly pimp.
I got the wire on that propane scam you're working.
You've been tricking Tammy out all over town.
Driving around in your kitty, shaking Jays down for bills.
Pretty sweet little operation you got going on for a small town plan.
I can't believe this I believe it homie she's my hole and I better have my hole in my car ready to go back to my hood in one hour or you're gonna be my hole you dig
Yeah, bet it seemed like the sweet life at first.
Trick out a couple of ladies, make some spare scratch, but you never see the dark side until those silk sheets form a noose around your neck.
Shut up, Dale.
I've got to find Tammy.
Hey, bring me back to Redhead!
You.
Alabaster came by my house.
Oh, dang.
Who is Alabaster?
Tammy's pimp.
She is a prostitute.
I think that is a terrible thing to say.
Why would you even think that?
Because Tammy is a hooker.
Is this true?
Peggy, I'm totally sorry.
You get out your hooker stuff of my house.
Goodbye, Mrs. Hill.
Bye, Mike.
See you in school.
Well, did you really even want to get your GED or was that just another lie?
No, I wanted to go straight.
So bad.
But I was making janky ass payets, Strickland.
And I was never going to save enough money to move out of your place.
And I just fell back into the life.
Oh.
But I'm almost finished with Kongo.
I'm up to the part where they shoot the super monkeys with the ray gun.
You actually are reading it.
Tammy, you compromised the sanctity of my propane route.
Now I have to look that pervert Lane Prattley in the eye, and he thinks I'm a pimp.
Dude, nobody thinks you're a pimp.
But if you were a pimp,
You'd be the coolest, nicest, most awesome pimp there ever was.
What the alabaster?
Hank, quick turn there.
Oh, dang.
I'm on your ass now.
All right, hang on.
This is gonna get hairy.
What are you doing?
Getting him just where I want him.
Huh.
He ran a red.
You can't do that.
All right, I'll lose him in the alley.
That's it.
Hank, pull over.
Let me out.
Tammy, no.
This isn't your problem.
You dudes have already done more for me than anyone ever has.
I'm gonna go back to OKC with Alabaster.
Hank, please don't let her.
Granted, she's a prostitute and she did use you as something of a pimp, but we all make mistakes.
You stay here.
Hank, don't.
Alabaster's a little guy, but he'll mess you up.
No offense, but he's from Oklahoma.
Peggy, give me the hat.
All right, man.
Get out of that jalopy and let's talk some business.
Oh, so you ready to give me my hoe back?
She's not going anywhere, chump.
But I am a fair businessman, so here's all the money she's given me so far.
Man, this feels a little light.
You jacking me?
I am the Mac Daddy of Heimlich County.
I play it straight up, yo.
You get the hell out of my hood.
She's my hoe now.
All right, all right, man, you can have her.
I got a stable of holes waiting on me in the OKC.
Yo, what you want for that jasper, Brunette?
That is my wife.
Man, that's the biggest mistake a pimp could make.
Marryin' one of his hoes.
Hank?
What are you looking at?
Please Hank, don't turn me out.
I'm no good.
Ask anyone.
Ask my wife.
No Dale, we're all going straight.
From now on, the only woman I'm pimping is Sweet Lady Propane.
And I'm tricking her out all over this town.
Alabaster!
