Listen guys, I sent the cards out about a month ago for a 20th wedding anniversary barbecue, and well, Piggy is kind of a stickler for those things, so I'm gonna need your RSVPs.
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Alright then, so it's official.
Are you gonna give a China Hank 20th anniversary China?
My marriage only made it to Wood.
No, but after the party, Luan's going camping with friends and Bobby's going to my dad's.
That means Peggy and I'll have the whole weekend to ourselves.
So I won't be in the alley as much.
Twenty years.
If your marriage were a murderer, it'd probably be out by now.
Hello.
Oh, hi Tracy.
My aunt is so happy I'm going camping with you.
She and Uncle Hank are gonna get so busy.
What?
Do they expect the forest fire to last the whole weekend?
Oh, bye.
Is everything okay, honey?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, they just up on to remind me to bring an extra can of gravy.
No.
Bobby, my camping trip's been cancelled and the shelter says I have to be better to stay there.
So can I go with you to Cotton's?
No way.
This is my last chance for Grandpa to spoil me before the baby's born.
You stay away from him.
He's mine.
He doesn't even know your name.
Yes, he does.
I'm Missy Melons.
Remember, these baby clothes are just on loan until I get pregnant with my second child.
Maybe this weekend.
It is so unfair that your eggs are rotten.
Well, for your information, my eggs aren't just fine.
It's Hank's narrow urethra that's the problem.
Although, no one's to blame.
No, I'm just stating a fact.
I would like to make a toast to Hank and Peggy Hill, Billy.
They have been married 20 years, not a long time.
Me and I have only been married 13 years, but it's quality, not quantity, that matter.
Last year, on our anniversary, Me and I bungee jump off Rod's 74 Bridge.
I love you men super nuisance prawn.
I love you con super nuisance prawn.
Oh, you guys didn't have to do this.
I know, but Nancy said we did.
Yeah, they're Canes.
Yeah, read the card.
Okay.
For when the hills are over the hill.
Get it?
Your last name's Hill.
Mm-hmm.
There's not much to get is there.
Okay everybody, let's settle down.
Now, this is not my award-winning The History of Propane slideshow, but it's the next best thing.
My marriage to Mrs. Peggy Hill.
I call it 20 Years of Outstanding Service.
Oh, hi.
Here we see the early years when our first home was an efficiency apartment although it would have been more efficient if it was heated with propane.
Our bed was our only piece of furniture and it was all we needed.
Yep, because it converted into a couch.
Bobby's head pretty much regained its shape and Peggy pretty much regained her shape too.
Seriously, that was the day Bobby was born.
And here's Peggy and me whooping it up at the young gassers ball.
It slides so longer than their marriage!
Is this hank and Peggy Hill 20 years from now?
I hope so because I wouldn't want it any other way.
Here's to 20 more years of outstanding service.
Well, I have summarized our marriage in a different fashion that I hope you will find no less pleasing.
I begin.
We planted our seed a long time ago and for 20 years we watched it grow into a beautiful garden of give and take and now it's time to cut the cake.
But before we do I'd like to say I would like to say I'm so glad you're here today to share with us.
The baby kicked my insides.
It puts on quite a show when it gets going.
DD, show him your gas tank.
This one's busting to get out.
Not like Hank, never moved once while he was in there.
Not even born and they already give up.
Well, I'm leaving for the weekend.
Got my gravy.
Okay, where to?
Anywhere but here.
Oh, not the dress bar and I bounced a check.
Or the nail salon for the same reason.
Bye!
Take a good look because the next time you see me, I'll be spoiled rotten.
Alright.
Hey guys, just letting you know, if you do serve ice cream for dinner, I won't tell.
Bobby, this ain't no Basky Robbins vacation.
Then he's with child.
She's useless.
Now, you can start by cleaning the back of my ears.
Well, that was great.
We ran out of potato salad and meat at the same time.
Perfect.
I thought my slideshow went over pretty big.
All in all, a pretty good day.
Happy anniversary, Peggy.
Don't wake me up when you come in.
Look, if you're worried about the mess, you can clean it up later.
If you're worried about Bobby, he's gonna be fine at Cotton's.
It's just a weekend.
I had to survive a whole childhood.
Hank, we're old!
Oh, Peggy, that was just a joke slide.
Although the photo mat did make you look older than me.
No, it's not the joke slide, Hank.
The joke slide was funny, okay?
It's all the other slides.
I saw a young married couple and I did not recognize them.
I mean, Hank, we look like strangers.
Strangers who stole our glasses and our hair.
Well, I assure you it was us.
Whatever happened to that young couple with their dreams of inventing a steak sauce and getting rich or taking a train to Alaska?
That couple just grew up and realized that there was too much competition among existing steak sauces.
We did ourselves a favor by abandoning those dreams, Peggy.
Well, maybe we should just start using those canes that Dale gave us and we could bash ourselves over the heads and be done with it.
Look, Peggy, we've both been looking forward to this weekend.
The kids are out of the house.
We've rented an R-rated movie.
Uh-huh.
We'll fry up some Jiffy Pop.
Uh-huh.
What movie did you rent?
Platoon.
Lady Bird!
It's me, Luan!
Here you go, girl crazy!
Good girl!
Yes!
Come on, baby!
In here!
This is the baby's room.
Decorated it myself.
You see this picture?
That's me.
Before I had my shins blown off.
What's that you're holding?
Hand of a nazi.
Ah, no, it's a canteen.
Hey, Jim, I'm looking for a nice restaurant to take my wife to for our anniversary.
All right, let's see.
Here's that revolving restaurant in McMainterbury.
Got a seven in the Auto Guide.
A seven?
Wow.
Well, I'll get my highlighter and I'll throw together a triptych for you.
Now, you want the direct route or the scenic?
Most folks tell me the extra five minutes is worth it.
Uh, direct.
Now, what do you know?
You can see all the McMainer Berry.
Huh, there's that automall they're always bragging about.
And in about 30 minutes, we will be facing the sunset.
Hi!
Can I get you folks anything to drink?
Oh, you know, I've never tried a Singapore sling.
I think that has alcohol in it, Peggy.
Unless you want me to be the designated driver.
Hank, this night is supposed to be special.
Okay, I won't have my beer then.
No, I won't have anything.
Well, maybe we can both drink.
How much do you weigh?
I'll just have water, thank you.
I'll have a beer.
That restaurant was no seven.
Look, I didn't know the restaurant only revolves at lunch.
You know, that didn't seem to stop anybody else from having fun.
Well, maybe.
It's because they were allowed to drink, Hank.
I see.
That's a shot at me.
Alright.
I'll make you that Singapore sling you wanted.
I changed my mind.
I want Tequila.
That was fun.
Haven't done that in a long time.
Let's talk more lines.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Got you on my bun.
That little river band sure was good.
Yep, they were a real seven.
No, you just let that go, will ya?
Just enjoy the music.
There's no music, Hank.
All there is is the sound of an empty house.
What was that?
Just the sound of all the children we never had.
I couldn't give them to you, Peggy.
It's my fault.
I have a narrow urethra.
Yes, I do.
This is my urethra.
Nothing.
I ran the 40 in 5.9 seconds, but my fellows haven't reached their end zone in 12 years.
What are we going to do now?
Well, I'm gonna do what I should've done a long time ago.
Here I go.
Peggy, wait!
Hold on.
Why are you throwing out the baby stuff?
I thought we were gonna give it to Dee Dee.
She doesn't need our baby stuff.
She has a baby.
No, Peggy.
I'm the one that deserves to be thrown out.
Hey, don't go in there without me.
Ugh.
Ugh.
You wanna go out for some pancakes?
Bobby, get in here.
Bobby, this is Topsy.
Topsy babysit your daddy when he was a boy.
And he's gonna babysit your uncle, too.
I need the money.
Mm-hmm.
You're the au pair they were talking about.
Come here, son.
Go ahead and get a good look at you.
Go on, Bobby.
Let Topsy get a look at you.
Okay.
I'm not gonna bite you.
He can't!
Had all his teeth yanked out of his head because he was green.
Yet a little closer.
My eyes ain't as good as they used to be.
Topsy's legally blind!
Do it again, Topsy!
Could you please not use the turn signals?
I'm not using the turn signals.
That's the vein in the side of your head pounding.
Well, I don't feel any better yet, do you?
Wait till you have the hotcakes.
Hair of the dog.
Pelo de perro.
You know, Peggy, I was thinking, maybe we could do some traveling.
Maybe take that trip to Alaska after all.
Oh, I've always wanted to see Spain or Australia.
Who are we kidding, Hank?
We can't go anywhere.
Not until Lady Bird dies and Bobby moves out of the house.
Hank, look.
Huh.
Let's do that.
Do what?
Parachute.
Con and men bungee jumped off a bridge.
Why can't we jump out of a plane?
Con and men are nuts.
I have given you 20 years of outstanding service, Hank.
I don't know.
Look, we fell asleep in a garbage can last night.
You want that to be the highlight of our 20th anniversary?
Beauty woman, light me a cigar.
I hope he treats the baby better than he treats you.
Oh, he will, Bobby, until the baby crosses him.
Beauty woman, where's my lunch?
A man could starve to death waiting for you to serve him.
I'm going to the bottomless pit to watch some naked women's dance while I eat.
And we're closed on Thursdays, okay?
Happy landings do you do?
So, what'd they say?
Well, they're all booked up for the rest of the month.
But they have a couple of spots open today.
Geronimo!
Where's that sock?
Cotton's grandson?
Oh, come in!
Great!
I just took those out of the dryer.
Where'd all this water come from?
Bobby, my water broke.
It means the baby's almost done.
Now?
Soon.
You have to phone Cotton.
I don't know the number for the bottomless pit.
It's number one on the speed dial.
And number three.
Bobby, this better be good.
The next gal up plays ping pong without a paddle.
Titi's gonna have the baby.
Won't meet you at the hospital.
But Titi can't draw.
She needs to call them.
Come on, Topsy.
Let's roll.
Which way is the Houston hospital?
I'm not sure.
Pull over and ask for directions.
I can't do that.
I shouldn't even be driving this car.
Oh.
I know where the Arlen hospital is.
It's two hours away.
Can you hold it in?
Oh.
Go around!
Please, go around!
I can't see where I'm going!
Oh, put it on cruise control and stand on the seat.
That's what Cotton does when we pass an accident.
I can't!
The red light keeps telling me to brake!
Oh, I think you need to release the parking brake!
Aw, fart!
Okay, you're all here for different reasons, and personally I don't care what those reasons are.
But you'll all be joined together by the one thing I do care about.
Parachuting.
You have never experienced anything like what you're about to experience here today.
Nothing comes close, not even sex.
Don't get me wrong, I like sex.
A lot.
But parachuting is... God, it's hard to explain.
This guy may be able to skydive, but he sure can't teach worth a damn.
Mm-hmm.
Well, teaching is much harder than it looks.
Excuse me while I kiss the sky!
Good!
Next!
First time?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Me too.
It's our 20th wedding anniversary.
Congratulations.
I've wanted to do this ever since I was a kid.
I'm a virgin.
Where's my wife?
Hello?
I'd do something, Topsy!
I'll do something else!
Come on, pick up, pick up!
I don't want to see her private!
She's my grandmother!
Turn this pizza!
Go!
Oh my god!
I can see Strickland propane from here.
It's beautiful.
You want to jump or not?
You've got my check.
What do you care?
Peggy, wasn't that amazing?
Yeah, we did it!
Mrs. Hill!
Your husband's on the radio!
Peggy, you were right.
It's amazing.
It's like selling a million grills all at the same time.
With extended warranties, you've got to do it.
Hang on.
I can't.
We have to turn the plate around.
You want to jump or not?
Uncle Hank, Dee Dee's at the hospital.
She's having the baby right now.
Oh my God.
Peggy, great news.
Dee Dee's having the baby.
I'm about to be a brother.
What a day.
Peggy, can you hear me?
Yes, Hank.
That's wonderful news.
We will be landing in just a few minutes.
Wait.
I changed my mind.
Piggy Hill is gonna jump.
This is terrific!
Woohoo!
Oh, the head is crowning!
Oh, it's got hair!
Where you going, Daddy?
Don't you want to cut the cord?
The cord!
Pull the cord!
Woohoo!
Okay!
Your emergency cord!
Peggy?
Oh-ho-ho!
