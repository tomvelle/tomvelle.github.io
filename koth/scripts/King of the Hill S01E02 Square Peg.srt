1
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:45,458
I'm in my office.

2
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,724
Peggy, I've got a situation here.

3
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:54,410
Oh, Hank, is it your back again?

4
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,034
Why won't you wear that weightlifting belt I got you for Christmas?

5
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,037
It's not a belt, it's a girdle.

6
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,640
Take off your shirt, I'll get the icy hot.

7
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:13,933
Ooh, ah, icy, icy, ah, hot, ah.

8
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:14,894
All right.

9
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,156
Okay.

10
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:16,796
Hey.

11
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:18,779
Peggy, not in front of the B.O.Y.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,583
I need both of you to sign this permission slip.

13
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:22,084
Alrighty.

14
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:23,546
What's it for, son?

15
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,288
Contact football?

16
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:26,970
No, you're not old enough for that.

17
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,033
Ringworm test?

18
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:29,506
What?

19
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,128
Sexual education?

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,791
Where'd you get this?

21
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,314
I told you, at school.

22
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,480
Oh, I thought we didn't have to worry about this until ninth grade health class.

23
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:38,241
Uh-uh.

24
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:42,588
Principal wants to teach us a unit from some course they made up in Washington, D.C.

25
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:43,490
Washington?

26
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,153
Bobby, go to your room.

27
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,601
Well, what are we gonna do?

28
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,424
Here's the first thing I'm gonna do.

29
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:52,225
I'll tell you what.

30
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:53,788
There.

31
00:01:54,308 --> 00:02:00,235
No need for Bobby to get all bothered up learning about sex when he can't do a damn thing about it anyway at his age.

32
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,218
And with his features.

33
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:08,025
Besides, it is not up to the United States government to be teaching Bobby the facts of life.

34
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,847
That's his parents' job.

35
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:10,748
I agree.

36
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:16,075
If anybody should teach our boy about that, it should be his parents.

37
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:19,319
Something like that should be taught in the home.

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:19,940
Uh-huh.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,722
Where he lives.

40
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,723
Absolutely.

41
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,045
Yes, sir.

42
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,178
Well, you're the expert.

43
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,606
Substitute teacher of the year 1996, as I recall.

44
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,250
Oh, Hank, I'm also a decent woman.

45
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:39,757
I got my back out here, Peg.

46
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,690
Bobby?

47
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,096
Bobby, honey?

48
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,295
What do you know about sexual relations?

49
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:56,677
I don't know.

50
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:58,078
Nothing much.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,803
I'm a little worried about being a slut.

52
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:02,544
Uh-huh.

53
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:12,035
Well, Bobby, your father and I decided that as your parents, that you and I should have a little talk on the subject.

54
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:19,304
You have noticed, I am sure, that there are some pretty big differences between boys and girls.

55
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,568
I'm sure you know that.

56
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:28,776
I mean, physically, boys are, they're different.

57
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:31,581
They have something that girls do not have.

58
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:32,924
Yeah.

59
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,731
You know, some thing.

60
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:39,156
You mean a penis?

61
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,600
I didn't take sex ed in school.

62
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,665
Come on, Boomhauer, if you're gonna prune, prune.

63
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:54,833
The army taught me everything, and in four different languages too.

64
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,277
Want to know how to get a bar girl in the Philippines?

65
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:04,910
The point is, there's no way my son is learning the how-tos of romance from some bureaucrat regulatory handbook.

66
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,713
Sumay Ho.

67
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,275
or something like that.

68
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,338
And Dale, I'd say the same applies to your Joseph.

69
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,621
I'd tear that permission slip up if I were you.

70
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,423
I'll do that and then some.

71
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,386
This sex head stuff goes higher than the schools.

72
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:24,594
It's that same old club of Rone Zero population bull dink that the UN's been trying for years.

73
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:30,220
I'll tell you what, man, it branch-fishing, it's going down, it's going to get y'all with your heads up.

74
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:34,643
They want to whittle us down so we can't keep a standing army.

75
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,648
That's when the Chinese will come marching in.

76
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,816
All I'm saying is keep the government out of the bedroom business.

77
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,423
Teaching my boy the facts of life is my job.

78
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:45,883
Damn.

79
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,426
You got that right.

80
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:49,570
Hank, I couldn't get the words out.

81
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,457
Oh gee, you didn't send her into a man's job, did you?

82
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:57,497
Uh, well, uh... Maybe you should let Boom Howard teach him what he knows.

83
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,902
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, he'd tell him about him dang old condom dispenser with them.

84
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:06,930
He'd put a little 50 cents in there and he'd try to hit that corner, turn his bang on that thing and just talk about her needs.

85
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:09,354
Oh, no, that's all right.

86
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,256
I guess I'll do it.

87
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:16,744
My daddy told me the facts of life when I was Bobby's age and I turned out okay.

88
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,935
EHA!

89
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,417
Hey, what you crying for, boy?

90
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:23,579
It's a good show.

91
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,142
This was a damn good show.

92
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:25,903
Yeah.

93
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:31,714
That's also how he taught me about paying taxes.

94
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:34,458
Well, there used to be a dairy farm out here somewhere.

95
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:35,781
Oh, there we go.

96
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,411
Gracie, this is Mr. Hill.

97
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,436
Brought his son over to learn the facts of life.

98
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,405
Well, he sure came to the right place.

99
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,909
We call this machine the Matchmaker 500.

100
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:58,964
Now Bobby, you're coming to a time in your life when you're going to start to have tender feelings for a girl.

101
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:04,433
You're going to need to know what those feelings mean and what to do about them.

102
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:12,218
Where's the other half of that dang permission slip?

103
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,281
I'm sure they will do a good job at school.

104
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,423
The health teacher is a trained professional.

105
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:17,103
Uh-huh.

106
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:18,124
Keep digging.

107
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:25,292
Hey Hank, I wouldn't sweat it anymore about that sex ed stuff.

108
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:25,892
What do you mean?

109
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:31,238
All you gotta know is I took care of it with one little phone call.

110
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:36,343
Hey, pig leg.

111
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,216
That was Bobby's principal.

112
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:42,560
Some right-wing maniac just called the health teacher with a death threat and she quit.

113
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:46,364
Oh, well, I'm sure it was just some harmless nutcase.

114
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:48,226
Damn, thank you, God.

115
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,607
Jeez!

116
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:56,214
Hey, on the bright side, since there's no one to teach that sex ed course, we can put all this ugliness back in the closet.

117
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:58,136
Oh, no, Hank, they found someone.

118
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:01,019
They found the substitute teacher of the year.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,640
Uh, 1995?

120
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,364
1996.

121
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:33,786
oh my oh lord oh for goodness sake this beauty school homework is hard Aunt Peggy Aunt Peggy huh oh I'm sorry Lou Ann I was not paying attention listen to this chapter title the 14 stages of arousal and then you turn the page and

122
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:34,920
Oh my goodness.

123
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,143
Is that Sea Everett Coop?

124
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:40,667
That must be an old book, because now there's 18 stages.

125
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:41,468
Oh my.

126
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,913
How am I going to say these words out loud in front of a class?

127
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:45,774
Let me see.

128
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:52,262
Self-exploration is a perfectly natural exercise throughout the pubescence.

129
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:53,344
What's so hard about that?

130
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,105
Luanne?

131
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:58,490
Honey, tell me, what is it like to live without shame of any kind?

132
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,172
Is it a good feeling?

133
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:02,355
Yeah.

134
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,947
Well, I guess I am a little jealous.

135
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,069
Things were very different when I was a girl.

136
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,653
Honey, you're at that special time of life.

137
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:15,076
The time when a little girl becomes a woman.

138
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,039
And you start getting a monthly visitor.

139
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,281
Who?

140
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,462
Uncle Joe?

141
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,266
My mother gave me this and I'm passing it on to you.

142
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,910
The loveliness of woman.

143
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:32,595
There's nothing in here but pictures of flowers.

144
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,508
I never even kissed a boy until I was twenty.

145
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,843
Of course he's dead now.

146
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,864
Look, here's a chapter on communicating your needs to your love partner.

147
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:46,628
What kind of filth are you reading?

148
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,450
It's Aunt Payee's sex headbook.

149
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,412
Say what?

150
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:50,834
Let me take a look at that.

151
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,737
What in the hell?

152
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,341
That is the inside of a womb.

153
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:56,763
A woman's womb.

154
00:08:57,584 --> 00:09:00,328
My boy is not going to look at the inside of a womb.

155
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,752
He's only been out of yours for 11 years.

156
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:04,995
I think I need some water.

157
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:07,686
You want my Chandler or my Ross?

158
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,950
Can I shoot him full of BB's?

159
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:10,952
Okay.

160
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,174
Then Ross.

161
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:14,979
You sure you don't want him?

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,701
Uh huh.

163
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,965
I'm not gonna need my toys anymore.

164
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,030
After I learn sex ed, I'll be too busy dating.

165
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:22,112
Who?

166
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:23,855
I don't know.

167
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,680
Whoever wants to have sex with me.

168
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,026
Well, what do you think?

169
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:30,769
A few more inches?

170
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:31,449
Might as well.

171
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,611
Just gonna keep growing.

172
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,134
Well, so much for my phone call.

173
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,075
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:40,020
They found some other deep-fraved harlot to teach that six-ed class.

175
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,422
Uh, Dale?

176
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,604
Don't worry, Hank.

177
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,568
I know people who can take care of this woman if you know what I mean.

178
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,350
That woman is my wife.

179
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:49,833
I thought Peggy was your wife.

180
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:53,798
Dale, I think he's saying Peggy's the new sex teacher.

181
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:01,606
Yeah, what?

182
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:02,847
Nothing.

183
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,649
I wouldn't say nothing at all, Hank.

184
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,492
You did nothing wrong with a little sexual education?

185
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:08,493
No, sir.

186
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,377
I bet Peggy'll be introducing some new ideas into the bedroom.

187
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:13,338
Dale!

188
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,421
I'm just saying a woman who knows is the toughest customer.

189
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,544
Maybe you ought to hit the books, too.

190
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,706
What the hell is wrong with you all?

191
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,808
What nothing, Hank, just think.

192
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:27,433
You'll be married to a woman who knows everything about sex.

193
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:29,235
I've never been with a woman like that.

194
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:32,150
Except, of course, a bar girl.

195
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:38,129
Of course, I don't mean that Peggy's a bar girl or nothing like that.

196
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,427
I mean, she just knows, you know, what a bar girl knows.

197
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,983
You know, there's a funny thing happening down at school.

198
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:58,174
They want me to teach this sex ed stuff to our kids class, you know, but I just don't know if I can overcome the crippling sense of shame that I got from my mother.

199
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,195
Phew!

200
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,857
Well, we knew you wouldn't.

201
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:08,226
Yeah, I've been telling people Peggy Hill is not one of those teachers that puts all that intellectual hooey above common decency.

202
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:09,688
Mm-hmm.

203
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:09,988
Well...

204
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,955
Well, sometimes a little intellectual hooey is a good thing.

205
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:19,404
Look, we all grew up not knowing the real words for your dinky and your woohoo, and we turned out fine.

206
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,367
I learned about sex from my mother.

207
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,893
She gave me that wonderful book, The Loveliness of Woman.

208
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,115
That book is worthless.

209
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,517
Well, I got a lot out of it.

210
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:34,929
When my husband would crawl all over me at night and do his business, well, I would just close my eyes and think of them pretty flowers.

211
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,972
Oh, Bonnie, you poor, poor woman.

212
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:42,722
Hey Bobby, your mom's gonna teach sex ed.

213
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:43,864
Yeah, I know.

214
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,311
We're gonna get to see your boobs.

215
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:49,696
So?

216
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:51,159
Bobby, you're up!

217
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:56,530
Your dad lost his job.

218
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:00,313
Run, run!

219
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,114
Come on, run!

220
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,658
Don't stop at first bite, son!

221
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:04,659
Go on the way, Bobby!

222
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:05,761
Go on the way, honey!

223
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:15,034
Yeah, yeah, go all the way, you perv!

224
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:15,274
Hello?

225
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:23,426
You don't know who I am, but I know where you live, and if you teach that six-head class, so help me out.

226
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:23,586
Dale?

227
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:24,848
Is that you?

228
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,373
Oh, hey, uh, can I speak with Peggy?

229
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:29,836
Uh, Peggy, it's for you.

230
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:30,717
It's Dale.

231
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:32,979
Yellow, Dale.

232
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,743
You don't know who I am, but I know where you live.

233
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:40,286
Boy, you should have heard Bonnie today.

234
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:43,629
That woman has got one awful love life.

235
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,371
Uh-huh.

236
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,171
Oh, my God.

237
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:48,253
Hi, Aunt Coney.

238
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,536
Would you like to rub some pretty feet and hands on my back?

239
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:54,459
Uh, isn't that just for your feet and hands?

240
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,700
Well, mainly.

241
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:57,702
But you could use it everywhere.

242
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:58,507
I'll pass.

243
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,150
Well, how about if I put a little on your elbows?

244
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,472
It'll moisturize and exfoliate.

245
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:05,114
My elbows are fine.

246
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,016
You never complained about them before.

247
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:09,459
It's just that it's so nice and cooling.

248
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,461
It makes your elbows smooth.

249
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:12,102
What?

250
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:16,166
Where in the hell are my elbows gonna be that they need to be smooth?

251
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,631
Well, honey, I just thought it would be nice, you know, for later, for us to be all smooth.

252
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,875
I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but I'll pass.

253
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:30,158
Look, Hank Hill, I did not ask to teach this class, but I am a substitute teacher.

254
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:39,235
That means I have to be prepared to go wherever they need teachers most, at any hour of the day or night, and teach anything from gym to home ec.

255
00:13:39,896 --> 00:13:41,079
I took an oath, darn it.

256
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:41,860
Excuse me.

257
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:46,048
And if I start to pick and choose, the whole system just breaks down.

258
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:51,134
Yeah, well, you weren't too proud to pick and choose when you had those Randy Travis tickets.

259
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:55,819
Oh, no, those poor little kids never did get to make their clay ash trays.

260
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:02,586
Well, they're damn sure gonna know the 18 stages of arousal, because Peggy Hill is gonna teach that class.

261
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:12,998
This is a diagram of a woman's...

262
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:17,084
Come on Aunt Peggy, you can do it!

263
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:29,637
A woman's the... This is a man's...

264
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:47,037
Well, what do you think?

265
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,945
Mm-hmm, nice and clean, but I think old Sigmund Freud might have a thing or two to say about it.

266
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,647
What?

267
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,308
Oh, no!

268
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:58,132
Happiness.

269
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,615
Happiness.

270
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:05,021
Happiness.

271
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:09,107
Happiness.

272
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:11,330
I did it.

273
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:13,613
Overease.

274
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:15,727
You villa.

275
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:17,509
Urus.

276
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:22,416
Vagina!

277
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,519
Hey Hank, I just said- I heard you.

278
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,723
The whole neighborhood can hear you cussing.

279
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,787
It's not cussing Hank to say the name of a God-given body part.

280
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:34,514
Well it is if it's a part of the body that was meant to be concealed by an undergarment.

281
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,538
You're dealing with organs that people just don't want to know about.

282
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,501
Well Bobby ought to know about them.

283
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,165
We don't want him growing up as repressed as we did.

284
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:42,926
Sure we do.

285
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,689
I'm drawing the line here, Peggy.

286
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,553
My son is not going to learn this crazy crap.

287
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:52,179
It says right here he can't take the class without permission of both his parents.

288
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,561
Now, just hold on.

289
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,666
Are you saying I am not good enough to teach my own son?

290
00:15:57,046 --> 00:16:00,151
If you do not approve, you do not have to sign.

291
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:01,272
And I do not approve.

292
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,434
Permission denied.

293
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:06,600
This damn strapping tape.

294
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:15,495
Come on, Bobby.

295
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:16,977
You're coming to work with me.

296
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,708
Uh, no, Mr. Hudson, we don't recommend using propane to fill party balloons.

297
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,995
Well, yeah, it is a gas, but it's in a liquid state.

298
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:47,515
Well, okay, but you might want to blow out those candles.

299
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:49,778
Look, I'm gonna have to call you back.

300
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,100
Bobby, hey, that's my work.

301
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,702
Now just sit still, okay?

302
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,687
What do you think mom's telling all those guys?

303
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:58,688
I don't know.

304
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,090
I don't want to know.

305
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,052
Just try not to think about it.

306
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:03,694
Okay.

307
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:08,560
What do you think mom's saying to him?

308
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,142
I said not to think about it.

309
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,045
Think about something else.

310
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,206
Okay.

311
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,543
Dad, do you ever have sex anymore?

312
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:24,535
Uh... Well, uh... Come on, Bobby.

313
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,399
Can't you think of something pleasant?

314
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:37,641
What do you think mom's telling all those guys?

315
00:17:43,544 --> 00:17:44,365
Good morning class.

316
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,670
Today we're gonna discuss the subject of human relations.

317
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:53,678
Otherwise known as... Human relations.

318
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,000
I am your substitute teacher.

319
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:56,562
My name is Peggy Hill.

320
00:17:58,465 --> 00:17:59,146
Oh, kiddokey.

321
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,129
Any questions so far?

322
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:04,113
Dad?

323
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:04,914
What?

324
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:10,362
I just wanted to say you don't have to worry about me because I'm never gonna have sex.

325
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:12,351
Oh, Bobby, now don't say that.

326
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,514
I thought that's what you wanted.

327
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:18,119
Well, yes, if you were my daughter, but you're my son.

328
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:23,325
Why is it not okay for girls, but it's okay for boys?

329
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,869
It's called the double standard, Bobby.

330
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:26,570
Don't knock it.

331
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,833
We got the long end of the stick on that one.

332
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:30,034
I see.

333
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:33,919
That's why mom's bad for talking about sex.

334
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:39,571
Bobby, look, just because your mom's been using those words doesn't mean she's bad.

335
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,835
She's just trying to do her job.

336
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:45,902
Give the kids the proper names for things.

337
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:56,481
Imagine how hard that is for your mother, trying to teach a room full of snicker and fifth graders the difference between a boy and a girl's, uh, you know, hookups.

338
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,001
That woman's got a lot of guts, I'll tell you what.

339
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,866
That's Mrs. Peggy Hill.

340
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:09,273
H-I-L-L.

341
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:13,899
You can call me Mrs. Hill, you can call me Peggy, or Peggy Hill.

342
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:18,666
Okay, come on Peggy Hill, you can do this.

343
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,413
Okay, today's subject.

344
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,470
Just have a seat.

345
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,815
I'm sure your teacher can tell you everything you need to know.

346
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:36,324
She was a substitute teacher of the year 1996, I understand.

347
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:41,292
Alright class, let's do it.

348
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:43,877
Today I'm going to teach you sex ed.

349
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:52,050
It's difficult subject matter, but if we approach it with common sense, I believe we might learn something that could enrich our lives.

350
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:55,233
But before we begin, please bring your permission slips up to my desk.

351
00:19:55,834 --> 00:20:00,561
And those of you whose parents did not give you permission to learn with me, well, you can read for an hour in the school library.
