WEBVTT

00:28.837 --> 00:29.358
Yep.

00:31.581 --> 00:32.062
Yep.

00:34.586 --> 00:34.906
Yep.

00:37.110 --> 00:39.573
Mm-hmm.

00:39.593 --> 00:40.775
You know what it could be.

00:41.576 --> 00:43.079
That damn starter motor.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.242
You're getting good compression.

00:45.943 --> 00:46.323
Yeah.

00:48.106 --> 00:49.428
I know what's wrong with it.

00:49.989 --> 00:50.830
It's a Ford.

00:50.870 --> 00:53.955
You know what they say Ford stands for, don't you?

00:54.356 --> 00:56.599
It stands for fix it again, Tony.

00:57.659 --> 00:59.703
You're thinking of a fiat, Dale.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.251
Fix it again.

01:06.919 --> 01:15.617
I'll tell you what you do, you just take them dang old spark plugs out, and then that little hole, you just put a little hole around there, just like Bobby Hunter says, I could go boom, boom, just like that.

01:17.352 --> 01:19.975
Well, I wish it were that simple, Boomhauer.

01:20.415 --> 01:22.598
But I'll tell you what my truck really needs.

01:23.299 --> 01:23.919
Leadership.

01:24.700 --> 01:32.389
Detroit hadn't felt any real pride since George Bush went to Japan and vomited on their auto executives.

01:32.409 --> 01:32.950
Who's ready?

01:39.197 --> 01:41.419
Y'all catch a Seinfeld show last night?

01:41.669 --> 01:42.691
Yep.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.033
Oh, hell, I missed it.

01:44.053 --> 01:50.544
I'll tell you what, you see that part where Daniel George come in there and talk about tasting his own burp and cream or come sliding in.

01:50.685 --> 01:51.987
I always do that.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.470
I'll tell you what, man.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.393
Them dang old New York boys.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.378
Just to show about nothing.

02:27.130 --> 02:34.059
Whatcha listenin' to, son?

02:34.480 --> 02:35.782
I don't think you like it.

02:36.042 --> 02:36.603
Well, why not?

02:37.043 --> 02:39.166
I like this new generation of music.

02:41.709 --> 02:44.313
Hello?

02:44.333 --> 02:46.856
Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.

02:47.357 --> 02:48.599
Where did you record this?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.020
I bought it at the mall.

02:50.141 --> 02:51.923
It's a funny phone jerks.

02:52.021 --> 02:53.222
Let me tell you, Bobby.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.745
There's nothing funny about these sounds.

02:56.265 --> 02:59.969
What that person on your tape has is a medical disorder.

03:00.469 --> 03:02.211
Now, you get ready for the game, okay?

03:02.931 --> 03:03.532
Yes, sir.

03:04.533 --> 03:05.674
That boy ain't right.

03:08.276 --> 03:08.857
Oh, God!

03:09.417 --> 03:11.039
Luanne, I thought you went home.

03:11.499 --> 03:13.662
No, Uncle Hank, Mom and Dad are still fighting.

03:14.202 --> 03:18.706
Well, you're welcome to stay, but for God's sakes, girl, lock the door.

03:19.147 --> 03:21.589
I've got a minor son living in this house.

03:24.252 --> 03:27.638
So you ready to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?

03:28.379 --> 03:29.681
Okay.

03:29.701 --> 03:31.224
Nah, don't you worry son.

03:31.284 --> 03:32.506
You just do your best.

03:32.867 --> 03:34.269
Don't listen to her, Bobby.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.356
If you want to win, you're gonna have to do better than your best.

03:38.656 --> 03:39.959
How do I do that?

03:40.379 --> 03:41.521
You gotta give 110%.

03:42.303 --> 03:45.668
That's what'll give you that winning edge.

03:46.029 --> 03:49.635
But what if the Wildcats give 110% too?

03:49.835 --> 03:51.737
Well then you gotta try even harder.

03:51.997 --> 03:54.339
How about if Bobby gave a hundred and twelve percent?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.041
Uh, sure, that'd work.

03:56.962 --> 03:59.364
Or maybe a hundred and thirteen.

04:00.925 --> 04:02.507
Yeah, yeah, that's even better.

04:03.107 --> 04:06.210
No, I don't know, thirteen is a very unlucky number.

04:06.350 --> 04:08.593
Look, we're not talking about thirteen.

04:08.713 --> 04:14.718
We're talking about a hundred and thirteen and even... Okay, give a hundred and twelve.

04:14.798 --> 04:15.699
What's the difference?

04:16.180 --> 04:18.762
Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?

04:22.117 --> 04:22.958
Swing, Bobby!

04:22.978 --> 04:23.398
Swing!

04:23.579 --> 04:24.079
Swing!

04:24.520 --> 04:27.163
And y'all the dang ol' dick lone apt at ball one.

04:27.383 --> 04:28.545
Good eye, honey, good eye.

04:30.567 --> 04:31.928
Oh, for crying out loud.

04:34.251 --> 04:40.158
Bobby, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs and you can't get on base without taking a swing.

04:40.659 --> 04:42.581
The pitcher could walk me, couldn't he?

04:43.582 --> 04:45.524
Don't play lawyer ball, son.

04:45.805 --> 04:47.787
Now you hit the next one out of the park.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.762
Look at the batter, boy.

05:01.143 --> 05:02.104
Watch the ball.

05:02.464 --> 05:02.865
Huh?

05:03.626 --> 05:04.147
What?

05:04.728 --> 05:05.869
Hey, don't look at me.

05:05.969 --> 05:07.752
Keep your eye on the ball.

05:07.992 --> 05:09.854
Keep my eye on the what?

05:10.095 --> 05:11.376
Stop looking at me, boy.

05:11.617 --> 05:12.478
Watch the ball.

05:13.119 --> 05:13.960
Can't hear you, Dad.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.467
Don't worry, Bobby.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.529
You played a good game.

05:21.710 --> 05:26.717
I got to stop in here for a minute and get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.

05:35.033 --> 05:36.154
I hate this place.

05:36.895 --> 05:39.259
Excuse me, where's the hardware department?

05:39.739 --> 05:43.184
Where is the hardware department?

05:44.445 --> 05:45.687
What exactly is it you're looking for?

05:45.707 --> 05:47.449
The hardware department.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.313
Yeah, but are you looking for like a tool or something?

05:50.634 --> 05:52.076
What difference does it make?

05:52.937 --> 05:55.580
Huh, what difference does it make?

05:55.600 --> 05:59.185
Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die and some WD-40.

05:59.384 --> 06:00.526
Huh.

06:00.546 --> 06:01.747
What is it that you're trying to do?

06:02.048 --> 06:08.577
I'm trying to buy a tap and die and some WD-40 and get out of this God-forsaken store.

06:09.177 --> 06:10.199
Ah.

06:10.219 --> 06:11.260
And what is it, tap and die?

06:11.501 --> 06:12.402
Okay, forget it.

06:12.923 --> 06:14.345
Let's say I want a hammer.

06:14.725 --> 06:16.107
Do you know what a hammer is?

06:16.528 --> 06:17.349
That's what I want.

06:17.469 --> 06:18.450
A damned hammer.

06:18.771 --> 06:21.274
Now where in the hell would I go?

06:21.254 --> 06:24.323
Hey, that's that Hank Hill fella that lives on the block next to us.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.606
He sure has a temper, doesn't he?

06:25.827 --> 06:26.388
Sure does.

06:26.910 --> 06:28.695
Makes you wonder who gave his boy that black eye.

06:30.219 --> 06:32.164
Uh, you're gonna have to pay for that, dude.

06:32.485 --> 06:33.508
You're fired!

06:34.501 --> 06:45.233
You say he hit his son with a bat?

06:45.313 --> 06:54.343
No, that is definitely not acceptable.

06:55.545 --> 06:59.489
I wish I could, ma'am, but the regulations say we can't take custody of the boy without an interview.

07:00.690 --> 07:02.132
Don't you worry, he's in the system now.

07:02.472 --> 07:03.934
I am on my way.

07:06.563 --> 07:10.387
Hey, I know what's wrong with your truck.

07:10.688 --> 07:13.191
It's your quote-unquote pollution controls.

07:13.671 --> 07:15.834
I heard on talk radio you don't even need them.

07:16.074 --> 07:18.236
They're just an egghead government plot.

07:18.256 --> 07:21.780
How is cutting down on pollution a government plot, Dale?

07:22.121 --> 07:23.522
Open up your eyes, man.

07:23.923 --> 07:25.965
They're trying to control global warming.

07:26.186 --> 07:26.546
Get it?

07:26.866 --> 07:28.128
Global.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.090
So what?

07:30.070 --> 07:35.516
That's code for UN commissars telling Americans what temperature it's going to be in our outdoors.

07:35.717 --> 07:40.662
I say let the world warm up, see what Boutros Boutros golly golly thinks about that.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.205
We'll grow oranges in Alaska.

07:43.826 --> 07:45.528
Dale, you giblet head.

07:45.848 --> 07:46.930
We live in Texas.

07:47.490 --> 07:53.157
It's already 110 in the summer, and if it gets one degree hotter, I'm going to kick your ass.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.423
What in God's name is that thumping sound?

07:59.669 --> 08:01.533
Bobby, why don't you go out and help your daddy?

08:02.035 --> 08:03.979
You have been watching way too much TV, son.

08:05.022 --> 08:05.322
Come on.

08:05.503 --> 08:06.686
Come on, Bobby, up.

08:06.706 --> 08:07.407
No more TV.

08:07.828 --> 08:08.390
Turn it off now.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.322
Oh, God, I love that poor man.

08:14.304 --> 08:14.444
Oh!

08:16.730 --> 08:17.050
There.

08:17.471 --> 08:18.133
That's better.

08:26.838 --> 08:28.860
Hello, I'm a social worker with the state.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.042
Would you mind if I talk to you for a minute?

08:31.222 --> 08:32.183
Well sure, come on in.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.246
Dammit, there it is again.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.609
Where is that thumping coming from?

08:38.049 --> 08:39.210
It's driving me crazy.

08:40.211 --> 08:41.833
Could be far off helicopters.

08:42.574 --> 08:44.816
You in helicopters.

08:44.836 --> 08:46.017
Dale, what are you doing?

08:46.097 --> 08:46.878
Give me some light!

08:47.338 --> 08:48.860
Now, I can't see!

08:50.201 --> 08:51.483
My arm!

08:51.503 --> 08:51.663
My head!

08:52.203 --> 08:53.064
Ow!

08:54.305 --> 08:55.967
Ow!

08:56.285 --> 08:59.008
Mrs. Hill, would you say your husband has a bad temper?

08:59.228 --> 08:59.869
Who, Hank?

09:00.490 --> 09:02.512
No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.

09:05.035 --> 09:07.498
No more bouncing that ball!

09:08.119 --> 09:09.300
Hank, we have a visitor.

09:14.406 --> 09:18.611
So your assertion, Mr. Hill, is that Bobby got the black eye at his baseball game?

09:18.931 --> 09:20.733
That's not my assertion.

09:20.913 --> 09:21.874
That's what happened.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.077
Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill?

09:24.377 --> 09:24.958
No.

09:27.368 --> 09:29.050
What the heck are you writing?

09:29.571 --> 09:31.273
All you got to write is one word.

09:31.413 --> 09:31.694
No!

09:32.174 --> 09:35.399
Mr. Hill, I feel that you're coming from an anger mindset.

09:35.799 --> 09:42.528
And if you're projecting this anger onto me, it gives me grave concerns as to how you facilitate your son's growth in private.

09:42.789 --> 09:46.534
Mr. I have not begun to project my anger onto you.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.678
Mrs. Hill, how did you get this here on your forehead?

09:50.058 --> 09:50.479
Oh, this?

09:50.519 --> 09:51.921
Well, Bobby threw his baseball at you.

09:51.941 --> 09:53.823
You threw a baseball at your mother?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.806
Oh, Hank, it was an accident.

09:56.883 --> 10:00.048
So would this be the same baseball that gave Bobby the black eye?

10:00.088 --> 10:04.875
Uh, Dale, you sure you want to be messing with Hank's truck when he's not around?

10:05.235 --> 10:07.318
I'm gonna help get him this alternator off.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.644
Uh, Dale, I think you released the brake cable.

10:12.145 --> 10:12.766
Dale!

10:12.986 --> 10:16.471
No, I didn't.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.973
I guess I better get going.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.477
I got some edging to do.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.643
Do you work outside the home, Mrs. Hill?

10:24.663 --> 10:25.764
Well, yes, I do.

10:25.784 --> 10:27.566
I'm a substitute Spanish teacher.

10:28.207 --> 10:30.669
Losestudiantes son, me saw me ghost.

10:31.049 --> 10:32.230
And you just have the one son?

10:32.531 --> 10:32.851
Uh-huh.

10:33.391 --> 10:37.975
Yeah, well, we would have liked to have more kids, but Hank has a narrow urethra.

10:38.136 --> 10:38.496
Peggy.

10:38.736 --> 10:40.358
In fact, Hank's sperm can.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.098
That's enough.

10:41.679 --> 10:43.841
What in the hell did you tell him that for?

10:44.221 --> 10:45.062
Well, he asked me.

10:45.222 --> 10:47.204
He asked you how many kids we have.

10:47.264 --> 10:49.146
He didn't ask you about my glands.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.567
Please, Mr. Hill.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.029
Loud is not allowed.

10:53.009 --> 10:53.410
What?

10:53.991 --> 10:55.474
Loud is not allowed.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.278
Now you listen to me, mister.

10:57.920 --> 11:02.550
I work for a living, and I mean real work not writing down gobbledygook.

11:03.271 --> 11:08.723
I provide the people of this community with propane and propane accessories.

11:08.703 --> 11:26.664
Oh, when I think of all my hard-earned tax dollars, going to pay a bunch of little twig boy bureaucrats like you, it just makes me wanna... Oh, God, it just... Honey, bring me my BC headache powder and a glass of water.

11:27.185 --> 11:27.927
All right, Hank.

11:28.565 --> 11:29.546
Now you listen here.

11:30.027 --> 11:31.108
You see that boy?

11:31.528 --> 11:32.649
That's my boy.

11:33.030 --> 11:39.377
And if you ever try to take him away, so help me, God, I'll tear you a new one bigger than the Grand Canyon.

11:40.078 --> 11:42.700
Now I want you to get out of my house.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.802
You're not welcome here.

11:44.482 --> 11:47.085
I mean now, before I give you a black eye.

11:47.666 --> 11:53.813
Get... You wanna know about ol' Hank?

11:53.833 --> 11:57.036
Well, Hank's got a lot of problems.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.221
Hey, baby!

11:58.622 --> 11:59.963
How about a couple of beers?

12:00.564 --> 12:01.285
Sorry, should.

12:01.325 --> 12:01.866
Gotta go.

12:01.926 --> 12:04.069
I got another migraine treatment with John Redcorn.

12:04.529 --> 12:09.716
Nancy, you've been going to that healer for 12 years and you still get headaches every night.

12:09.976 --> 12:11.659
Healing process takes time, honey.

12:15.063 --> 12:18.467
Getting back to the Hill family, have you ever seen Hank hit his child, Bobby?

12:18.748 --> 12:19.088
Hank?

12:19.529 --> 12:20.190
No, sir.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.972
Bobby's his pride and joy.

12:22.553 --> 12:25.116
Cause of his narrow urethra.

12:26.395 --> 12:27.438
Are you absolutely sure?

12:27.458 --> 12:28.380
100%.

12:28.821 --> 12:29.924
You can ask my son.

12:30.325 --> 12:31.568
He's Bobby's best friend.

12:32.129 --> 12:32.730
Joseph!

12:33.372 --> 12:34.294
What is it, Daddy?

12:34.836 --> 12:36.339
You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?

12:36.740 --> 12:37.763
No, I never.

12:38.284 --> 12:38.545
See?

12:40.008 --> 12:41.552
Now you can just move along now.

12:41.853 --> 12:44.315
I've been calling y'all people for better than a month now.

12:44.336 --> 12:46.918
Grabbed a shower every time a dangled dog crossed the street.

12:46.958 --> 12:50.081
Started y'all 24 hours a day, and nobody answered.

12:50.101 --> 12:52.984
You had called, asked if I was supposed to come out and do anything about that dog.

12:53.004 --> 12:57.569
If you're just gonna get a dangled computer, ain't gonna come over here and shut that dangled dog up.

12:57.589 --> 13:01.973
And then some weirdo came over and was asking us a bunch of questions.

13:02.334 --> 13:03.194
Yeah.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.217
He asked me if your dad ever whooped you.

13:05.677 --> 13:06.698
He hasn't, right?

13:06.958 --> 13:07.859
Of course not.

13:07.939 --> 13:08.940
You know my dad.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.662
He's all bark.

13:10.793 --> 13:12.635
Boy, that guy got him mad, though.

13:12.956 --> 13:19.805
My dad was like, get out of my house, my boy ain't much, but he's all I got.

13:21.847 --> 13:23.369
He did great impressions.

13:24.250 --> 13:24.971
Let me try.

13:24.991 --> 13:28.075
I'll tear you a new one.

13:28.516 --> 13:36.266
When I get my hands on you, you little pea brain, I'll bust your butt into little pieces.

13:36.826 --> 13:38.168
Oh, I knew it.

13:39.363 --> 13:42.286
Good God, Peggy, this was on the road and track.

13:43.066 --> 13:43.727
Luann!

13:44.187 --> 13:45.929
Luann, honey, can we talk to you?

13:46.309 --> 13:48.051
Wait, wait, not while I'm here.

13:48.111 --> 13:50.653
Mama's in jail.

13:51.234 --> 14:00.903
She was saving a quart of beer for before bed, and daddy threw it out, and she went after him with a fork, and the trailer tipped over, and everything went upside down, and it's all gonna be on real stories of the Highway Patrol.

14:01.543 --> 14:05.267
And the wig I styled for Beauty Academy is ruined.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.610
What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?

14:08.928 --> 14:10.690
There, there.

14:11.531 --> 14:18.740
You can stay with us till your mama comes home and you'll style a new wig better than before.

14:20.182 --> 14:21.483
I'll let you use my tools.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.447
Oh, thanks, Uncle Hank.

14:26.589 --> 14:27.671
She has got to go.

14:31.335 --> 14:31.655
Bobby?

14:32.296 --> 14:33.157
Bobby, are you all right?

14:33.338 --> 14:33.858
Come on out.

14:34.199 --> 14:35.901
I thought I told you to get lost.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.062
Come on, Bobby.

14:37.430 --> 14:42.515
I can put you with a nice foster family in North Ireland where you can develop healthy life adaptations.

14:43.176 --> 14:44.097
And they've got a pool!

14:44.457 --> 14:45.999
Honey, let's give him Lou Ann.

14:46.499 --> 14:49.042
Hey, I got a girl in here you can take right now.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.624
Don't you want to live in a house with a pool?

14:52.305 --> 14:52.605
No.

14:53.066 --> 14:53.987
See, twig boy?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.870
Now get your skinny butt off of my property.

14:57.170 --> 15:00.433
Bobby, I know you can't talk in front of him.

15:00.653 --> 15:01.494
I said get!

15:01.975 --> 15:02.255
Get!

15:02.635 --> 15:03.236
Get out of here!

15:04.017 --> 15:05.278
You are out of control!

15:05.338 --> 15:07.200
You're out of control, twiggy!

15:07.180 --> 15:14.308
Thanks for the latte, Kenneth.

15:14.889 --> 15:17.171
Anthony, could I see you a minute?

15:17.191 --> 15:18.573
It's on this Hill family case.

15:19.354 --> 15:23.539
You couldn't confirm any actual abuse, but you still recommended the state take custody?

15:24.119 --> 15:24.600
Oh, yeah.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.582
I mean, the whole neighborhood was Redneck City.

15:27.043 --> 15:29.926
Did you see in the report how he dented my G.O.?

15:29.946 --> 15:30.607
Redneck City.

15:30.867 --> 15:31.548
That's pretty funny.

15:32.189 --> 15:32.990
Where are you from, son?

15:33.430 --> 15:33.951
Los Angeles.

15:35.032 --> 15:35.112
Hmm.

15:36.070 --> 15:38.154
And see here, hit by baseball.

15:40.419 --> 15:42.503
So, how did you like old Harvey?

15:44.207 --> 15:44.628
Who's Harvey?

15:45.189 --> 15:46.251
Oh, he's a little league coach.

15:47.173 --> 15:49.658
You did talk to the little league coach, didn't you?

15:55.510 --> 15:58.233
Son, have you lost your mind?

15:58.253 --> 15:58.574
Wait!

15:59.134 --> 16:02.078
Dad, you're not supposed to yell at me anymore.

16:02.499 --> 16:09.387
The guy from the state said, your hostility invalidates our parent-child contract.

16:09.407 --> 16:11.910
You're quoting that twig boy at me?

16:12.110 --> 16:13.252
Hi, the neighbors.

16:13.592 --> 16:18.759
Remember, he said loud is not allowed, Dad, or they'll take me away.

16:21.141 --> 16:21.602
Oh, God.

16:26.948 --> 16:27.449
Hello?

16:27.729 --> 16:28.830
Is this the Hill residence?

16:29.511 --> 16:30.252
Who am I talking to?

16:30.772 --> 16:31.513
Bobby Hill.

16:31.953 --> 16:34.276
Well, son, this is the state social services.

16:34.676 --> 16:36.839
We're calling off our investigation of your father.

16:37.399 --> 16:40.983
The workers that visited you will be leaving the office and going back to LA.

16:41.684 --> 16:44.847
Now, you please tell your parents we apologize for the misunderstanding.

16:45.168 --> 16:46.429
OK, I'll tell them.

16:46.909 --> 16:47.230
Bye.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.692
Bobby, who was that?

16:49.712 --> 16:54.998
Uh, wrong number.

16:57.155 --> 17:10.949
I borrowed your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.

17:11.069 --> 17:14.232
It wouldn't start at first because you had a clogged fuel line, but I have a little bit clean.

17:18.576 --> 17:20.959
Hey Bobby, go plug this in the garage for me.

17:21.519 --> 17:22.200
Okay.

17:27.142 --> 17:28.664
Wanna see something cool?

17:32.862 --> 17:33.783
What in the heck?

17:33.983 --> 17:35.145
Don't you see I'm working here?

17:35.245 --> 17:36.386
Close the dang door!

17:37.607 --> 17:39.029
Bob, just keep put!

17:39.049 --> 17:39.369
Stop!

17:39.549 --> 17:40.751
Stop hitting that button!

17:40.931 --> 17:41.772
Give me that thing!

17:42.092 --> 17:46.237
Dad, that's not respectful adult child growth dialogue.

17:46.397 --> 17:51.142
I'll give you dialogue that's not coming from a center of anger.

17:51.663 --> 17:56.989
Please return the garage door to its factory preset down position.

17:59.632 --> 18:01.654
That is cool.

18:08.063 --> 18:13.710
Please, uh, respect my fences right to be a fence.

18:14.651 --> 18:31.793
Now!

18:33.747 --> 18:37.871
What on God's green earth are you making those noises for?

18:38.052 --> 18:39.233
There's sound effects.

18:39.513 --> 18:41.155
Like that guy in police academy.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.097
That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up.

18:43.197 --> 18:43.878
I decided.

18:44.178 --> 18:46.020
And dad can't say boo about it.

18:46.541 --> 18:49.984
Bobby, a man from the Child Protective Services just came by.

18:50.585 --> 18:55.090
Now, he said that he told you last week that this investigation was off.

18:56.531 --> 18:59.234
Oh, please don't tell dad.

18:59.675 --> 19:00.776
Well son, I have to.

19:00.856 --> 19:01.797
He's been worried.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.784
But I like him better this way.

19:04.305 --> 19:04.726
How come?

19:05.107 --> 19:07.754
I can make him love me even when I screw up.

19:08.796 --> 19:09.899
Is that what you think?

19:14.029 --> 19:14.991
It's hard, Peggy.

19:15.933 --> 19:19.482
I don't want to lose my little boy, my only son.

19:19.883 --> 19:20.985
But, oh, it's hard.

19:21.525 --> 19:22.827
Well, you can relax.

19:23.168 --> 19:25.511
The investigation has been off for a week.

19:26.072 --> 19:27.714
Only Bobby didn't tell us.

19:27.995 --> 19:28.676
I'll kill him!

19:28.796 --> 19:30.018
All right, calm down, honey.

19:30.058 --> 19:30.979
Now, let me explain.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.822
He didn't do it to be mean.

19:33.263 --> 19:36.007
Bobby honestly doesn't think that you love him all the time.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.048
That's crazy.

19:37.088 --> 19:37.829
Of course I love him.

19:38.130 --> 19:38.671
Very good.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.373
Now, say it to Bobby.

19:40.538 --> 19:41.539
What are you talking about?

19:41.859 --> 19:45.584
I want you to tell Bobby that your love for him is unconditional.

19:46.124 --> 19:47.165
Well, I can't say that.

19:47.726 --> 19:48.207
I can't.

19:49.008 --> 19:50.509
You know how I was raised.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.311
What my father's like.

19:52.812 --> 19:56.436
I got my shin blown off by a Japan man's machine gun.

19:56.956 --> 20:01.141
So don't come crying to me with your problems.

20:01.161 --> 20:02.443
Honey, I'm begging you.

20:02.803 --> 20:04.965
For the sake of this family, you have got to do it.

20:05.586 --> 20:07.288
He's waiting for you out on the porch.

20:07.522 --> 20:08.644
Oh, jeez.

20:09.144 --> 20:28.753
That twig boy comes over here and gets... Uh... You, uh... You're my son, uh... Well, you know, with everything, uh... That entails, uh... Uh...

20:30.590 --> 20:39.062
You know, feelings of fondness and more... You know what I mean, don't you boy?

20:39.082 --> 20:40.424
No.

20:42.907 --> 20:46.793
Well, that's a hell of a weird sound.

20:46.833 --> 20:47.914
I never made that before.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.983
You... family.

20:56.927 --> 20:59.010
You're not making this easy on me, boy.

21:00.863 --> 21:02.405
Okay.

21:02.425 --> 21:03.706
I love you no matter what you do there.

21:03.947 --> 21:04.167
Phew.

21:04.807 --> 21:05.969
Let's go get something to eat.

21:07.050 --> 21:10.954
I'm not just a big disappointment to you.

21:11.455 --> 21:13.077
Disappointment?

21:13.097 --> 21:14.719
No, you make me proud.

21:15.420 --> 21:18.984
I've been disappointed by just about everything else in this town, but you?

21:19.604 --> 21:20.205
Not once.

21:21.006 --> 21:23.409
Damn it, you're my boy.

21:23.429 --> 21:24.610
You know better than that.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.788
He punched him!

21:27.808 --> 21:28.130
I knew it!

21:28.312 --> 21:28.754
I told him!

21:28.815 --> 21:29.700
Did you see that?

21:30.103 --> 21:31.331
See what, big boy?

21:32.740 --> 21:33.283
Never mind.
