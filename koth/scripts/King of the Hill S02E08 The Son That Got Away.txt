I am like wood with brotherhood From sea to shining sea And many more Miss Supa News and Phone, please Now let's all settle, Mr. Hill We're going to sing My Bonnie My Bonnie is a lay ocean
My Connie lives next door to me.
My Connie is a Laotian.
And I have to go take a pee.
What did I tell you two?
Bobby, Connie, this is the third time this week.
I've suffered through everything from old man liver to the smello nose of Texas.
It's time we involved your parents.
Conn?
What are you doing here?
They framed Conn Jr.
I'm here to grease some palms.
You're here to read a gas meter, right?
That's your job?
No, I sell propane and propane accessories.
Bobby got in trouble too.
I had to take off work.
Why?
We're your wife.
She's still a good mother today.
Peggy is a substitute teacher.
Bobby, what's the idea of acting up in class?
Acting out, Mr. Hill.
We call it acting out.
I'm just saying a song parody, Dad.
Like Weird Al Yankovic.
Bobby Al Yankovic blew his brains out in the late 80s after people stopped buying his records.
He's not worth getting into trouble over.
Con Junior, I have Bobby dragging you down like a chicken fat anchor.
Time out.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
It's all knitting together.
You see, Bobby and Connie's disruptive behaviors stem from bad parental imaging at home.
You're saying it's my fault I'm here?
I won't play your blame game, Mr. Hill.
Your son mocked a beautiful Scottish folk song.
We owe it to ourselves to find out why.
Yeah.
He make a good point, Hank.
He says you're a bad father.
No, no, no.
You're not bad dads.
You have bad dad habits.
Gentlemen, let's try an active listening exercise.
Khan, I want you to tell Hank something you like about him while Hank actively listens to the compliment.
Bobby, Connie, watch and learn.
It's your boy's fault we're here.
He bad crowd.
You punish him.
You don't worry about Bobby.
You just punish con junior.
She's the mastermind behind all this.
Well, yeah, we'll be punishment darn right.
They'll be punishment.
Give me that
Joseph says Bobby's in the doghouse.
How you gonna punish him, Hank?
Well, sir, that boy's gonna clean my rain gutters.
Well, whatever works for you.
I believe a child benefits more from the psychological approach.
When I need to correct Joseph, I tell him he's adopted.
Yeah, my dad used to punish me by telling me I was a girl.
He used to make me wear dresses.
Pretty, pretty dresses.
Let's go, Bobby.
It's debt-paying time.
I wonder what old Khan has in store for Khan Junior.
What the... Khan, what are you doing?
Mowing the lawn is a privilege, not a punishment.
I'm putting fear of God into Khan Junior.
She learned what I like to be you.
You know, it's that kind of permissive parenting that forfeited your country to the communists.
Oh, baby birds.
Where's your mommy?
Ow!
Stop that!
Ow!
I was being nice to them!
That's a roof, not American bandstand.
Oh, Hank.
Let him dance.
He's happy.
Hi.
A bird pecked my head.
Ouch.
Parents are such a drag.
Yeah.
They're always treating us like kids.
We're not children.
We're preteens.
Damn it.
Let's get out of this dump.
Do something fun.
Yeah.
As long as we're back for supper, my mom's fixing pork pockets.
Okay.
It's a deal.
Let's boogie.
Why are you stopping?
We gotta get Joseph.
I don't like Joseph.
He threw a dodgeball at me once.
Well, I'm sure he had a good reason.
Hey, Bobby, you wanna do something?
Bobby already has plans with me.
Yeah, wanna come?
Sure.
So what do you guys want to do?
Well, we could go press the crosswalk buttons and run away.
Cool.
Bobby and I don't like to do that.
Well, Bobby and me do.
We could go to the library and talk.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Why don't we just go back to school and wait for tomorrow?
Hey, hey.
Come on, guys.
Don't make this a contest for my friendship.
Now, I say we go to Electric Town and watch TV.
We could go to the caves.
Come on, guys.
It'll be like sneaking into an R movie.
You've been to an R movie?
Yeah.
But the only person naked was Harvey Cotell.
We should go for it.
The caves are probably dark.
Let's get butane lighters.
My dad says butane's a bastard guess.
I'm getting scented candles.
This one smells like leather pants.
I got two chips and spray cheese.
They keep... I got glow wands and pantyhose for later.
What the hell are you doing?
In an old tan, man.
Oh, we just cleaned your gutters for you.
But that was Bobby's punishment.
Oh, maybe you'd call it punishment.
I'd call it punishment.
Where is Bobby?
Hey!
Con Junior!
Where are you?
Now it's starting to make some sense.
She did it again, Con.
Your little siren led my boy astray.
Your skin had gone too?
Boy, I tell you what.
When I do find those kids, they're gonna be in real trouble now.
Have you seen Joseph?
He's not back with my pick six numbers and I'm starting to worry.
I can't win it if I'm not in it.
Yeah, the entrance is in the weed somewhere.
The caves.
Hey, you shouldn't go in there.
Yeah, right.
Just play with your toy, Randy.
Later, loser.
Oh, wait.
Maybe Randy's right.
Bobby, if you're scared you can stay out here.
You can pretend it's headquarters.
Hey, you wanna watch me fly my plane?
Wait for me!
You'll be sorry!
You'll be s-
First we look for Khan Junior at Contemporary Art Museum.
Oh, sorry, Arlen doesn't have one.
Let's get one thing straight.
You may be driving, but I'm leading this posse and it's forced I will commandeer the vehicle.
Do you see them?
Do you see them?
Please take a pedal from Meadow.
They're probably at the mall.
Oh, my heart is racing here, men.
And when my heart races, my view follows.
Calm down for Peggy here.
Look at my hand.
Still has a more near water, Lily.
Well, being calm comes natural to you Buddhists.
So what if Connie's run away, huh?
She'll just come back as a grasshopper or a seahorse.
I'm so sorry, men.
I'm just a little on the edge.
Hey, look at this!
The Boneyard.
It's written in ancient English.
What's the Boneyard?
I can't remember.
It's either the place where old people go to die or young people go to make out.
Well, what if you're wrong and it's where young people go to die and old people go to make out?
I told you, Khan Junior not there.
Aha!
Khan Junior go there!
No American child would run away to a sheet music store.
They do if they want to hide from Hilla Billy parent.
Last place you look, Hilla Billy.
I thought you and men were looking for Bobby and Connie.
Well, men decided she'd rather look for them in a taxi.
Oh, I am such a jumbo.
Hey, Peggy, why don't you just sit down with the TV for a minute and clear your head?
OK.
But for just a moment.
Guess what?
My signal, my Tina has ran to the sports car in the name of those little babies.
Vaya, good dios.
I don't think I can make it.
Yes, you can, Bobby.
Grab onto my shirt.
Hey, we did it.
We're in the Boneyard.
Who's Frampton?
Score!
Playboy!
Great.
I haven't seen this one.
I hope there's an article by Norman Mailer.
Oh, check this out.
Our unabashed dictionary defines heavy petting as when things get out of control at a Weight Watcher's meeting.
He doesn't get it.
I'm starting to get things.
I thought the kids would be here sure as the world.
I'll be dipped.
Hey, Randy, have you seen Bobby and Joseph and that con junior?
Maybe, maybe not.
What are you gonna do?
We're gonna tan their hides.
They're in the caves.
I did the right thing.
I told them not to go.
I did the right thing.
You heard him, Hank.
We have no legal responsibility.
The caves?
Oh my god.
Wait, what's the problem?
There's good news, right?
Now we know where they are.
No, Con.
Heep bad news.
The caves are where Arlen teenagers go to make, well, whoopee.
Check it out.
It must have fallen off some woman.
Here, Conny, you can use this.
Thanks.
Hey, Conny, Conny!
I found you this.
Skull.
Yuck.
And I wrote you a song.
I'm a school man.
Yeah, that's great.
That was our last candle.
I'm scared.
Me too.
Me three.
Wait.
We've got glow wands.
Those are their bikes.
They're inside, all right.
Oh, God.
I can't see.
I can't see.
We're all gonna die.
Dale, you have your sunglasses on.
Got you.
Tell you what, Dale.
Why don't you go tell Peggy and men we're here so they don't worry?
I noticed my wife's name was not among those mentioned.
Am I to assume Nancy should continue worrying?
Are you gone now?
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
The kids are in the caves.
Oh my goodness.
That is where half of Arland's unplanned pregnancies begin.
Hank and Con have gone in to pry them apart.
Dear Lord, let them find those kids before I am in laws with men.
Maybe we should get back now.
Yeah, I guess.
No, it's this way.
Isn't it?
No, we came in that way.
I think.
Oh, no.
Yeah, we're lost.
Take me to Boneyard.
Hold on a second.
I don't remember which way to go.
It's been a while.
I need to get my bearings here.
Well, you get your bearings.
My child bearing your child's child.
I think it's this way.
I can't stop.
It's out of my control.
When you go, we're out of food.
I'm sorry.
When I'm upset, I get hungry.
We're all upset, Bobby.
But you're upset together, and I'm upset all by myself.
I see things clearly now.
I'm gonna grow up without anyone to love and die friendless and alone like Weird Al Yankovitch.
I won't stand in your way.
When the time comes, I want you to eat me.
You'd do that for us?
Of course I would.
You're my best friends.
My body is my gift to you.
But it wouldn't have to be if you'd left us some of those chips.
Oh, Bobby, that is so kind and... and brave.
Thank you.
I'm doing it for your children, too.
We have to think of them.
Oh, I'm starting to worry.
Hank and Conch have found them by now.
Don't worry, Nancy.
I'm sure they're safe and not exploring each other's bodies.
Even if they are, there's nothing that lovers do that can possibly take this long.
Am I right?
Yes.
If you only consider your own needs.
Oh, gosh.
I think I need a beer.
Uh, honey, you want a beer?
Yes.
Yes.
How did he know I wanted a beer?
Too narrow.
Must go back.
We've got to go forward.
Come on, shove me, dammit.
Now I stick it with a beer.
It's the worst birthday I ever had.
I didn't know it was your birthday.
I'm 41.
You know, I think we're lost.
Oh, you think so, huh?
Dale will bring the fire department.
They'll find us.
That's great!
All hopes for survival pinned on Dale Gribble.
I want to die like an English patient girlfriend.
Long, painful, boring death.
Well, if we're lost, the kids are probably lost too.
You make me nervous at Joseph with Con Junior.
His whole family like a Tennessee Williams play.
Well, Joseph's a good boy.
Say, why aren't you nervous about my Bobby?
Until Puberty, he do no worse than Hickey.
Besides, I know he a good boy.
I appreciate that, Conn, but I'll tell you what, many of good boys gone bad in the boneyard.
I shouldn't be telling you this, but it's where a lot of us got to second base for the first time.
What do you call second base?
Well, where I come from, it means, well...
Meaning that, you see, when two people are attracted to each other, uh, well, your hand... Don't explain a homerun, you have a heart attack.
In Laos, we call it, pasan peit.
Pasan peit.
I like it.
It sounds clean.
We need more good euphemisms like that in this country.
So tell me, uh, where'd you hit your first Poisson paint?
Languipro Bank City.
Wild town, man.
Spring break and two out of three guys are monks.
Try not to get some Poisson paint.
Hey, Bobby, that sounds like your dad.
And that sounds like your dad, Connie.
It can't be.
They're not yelling at each other.
Bobby!
Con Junior!
Hello, Joseph.
Hey, Mr. Hale.
Well, well, now we're all together.
Sit back and relax.
Wait for Dale Griffith to save us.
Son, stop that.
This is a desperate situation.
Besides, it's littering.
It's already littered, Dad.
Somebody else dropped it before us.
From up there?
Hey, there is a hole up there.
Look!
That could be our way out!
Hey, hold your fire up there!
Hey, man, you gonna do like that and go tell that old Hank doing down in a bone yard.
Man, you gonna get down here like a dope on around and go wrong with you, man.
Boom, Howard, I can't understand a word you're saying.
Must be the echo.
Just get the fire department to lower the rope.
Hank, ten-four to go, roll over that rope.
Oh, my little golden child!
Okay, Hank, put Bobby's bike in the trunk and buckle Bobby into the center of the back seat, facing us so we both can watch him.
Now, Peggy, he's not a baby anymore.
He's a preteen.
He and Joseph rode their bikes here.
They can ride them home.
Thanks, Dad.
Connie, you need a lift?
Yeah, Connie, you want a lift?
Con Junior, you come with me.
We go get ice cream and tetanus shop.
I think Connie likes you.
No, she likes you.
The minute he said we could eat you, she was yours.
Well, maybe she likes both of us.
Yeah, I'm gonna have trouble choosing between guys sometimes.
They like to have their cake and eat it too.
I hear ya.
Hey, Joseph.
Yeah?
Um, what were you eating under there?
Underwear.
Ooh, you were eating underwear.
Shut up.
Boxers or briefs.
You were such a goof.
Boxers or briefs.
Long paint for boring debt!
