Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey!
Oh Mickey, oh it's a fire, won't it believe?
You take me by the hog, and you take me by the hand.
Oh Mickey, you're so fine, what do you want to say?
Oh, man, you didn't have to bring cookies.
Hearing about all of your little Connie's academic achievements is all the treat that we need.
Oh, no problem.
Don't want them getting still while we go on a luxury trip to Mexico.
Me, Hiko.
Oh, Hank and I used to go every time they devalued the peso.
That got old pretty quick.
We stay in beautiful Mithad duplex condo with Khan's brother and family.
Oh, yes, lovely.
What Mithad mean exactly in English?
First class?
Deluxe?
Mithad.
You know, that's one of those words that doesn't translate easily.
Extra special luxury?
It conveys the idea of simple but relatively clean living.
Stupid, brother.
Now we back out on the trip and we stuck with full charge for Conoran.
We can't afford that.
We just bought a CD in jukebox.
Maybe crack our neighbor some use after all.
Holy neighbor!
Well, sure, there are some pros.
It's a good deal, and I guess there's nothing tying us to the house now that we've got automatic sprinklers, but there's also the cons.
The biggest one being, well, con.
Hank, I saw the brochure.
The condo is two stories and very metade.
You would barely have to see them.
If we stayed home, I wouldn't have to see him at all.
I can't think of a better vacation than that.
But it's also an opportunity to learn about another culture.
Now the last time Bobby went to Mexico, he was still on the breast.
I love Mexico.
They fast-track new makeup straight to the consumer.
Here are the FDA tests and tests for years.
It's like they don't care how we look.
Oh, come on, Hank.
I can finally replace that papier-mache pair I got when I was an exchange student in Oaxaca.
Come on, Dad.
It's the real iPhone of TV's Monsignor Martinez.
Well, okay.
If you all want to go, I guess it's Buenos Diaz, Mexico.
Oh Hank, I'm sorry, but you just said, Good God's Mexico.
Wish I could go on a luxury Mexican vacation.
Must be pretty expensive to stay in one of those me-tied condos.
Must cost at least 500 bucks.
Maybe you got it for 350?
How much you paying?
I'll tell you what, man.
About Mexico, man.
You go down there, they're gonna load up on them dang old chicklets, man.
That's how you go down there, wheeling, dealing with them dang old ass cock, talking about how a camino dos mujeres.
I think it's nice that you're going away, Hank.
You need a good vacation with your new best friend, Con, who you love so much.
Yes, Bill.
I love Con.
Maybe if this trip works out, I'll marry him and live in Mexico forever.
Is that what you want to hear?
No.
Every time I try to pass, he'll believe women speed up.
Don't be silly.
Peggy's not even thinking about you.
Drink again, hotshot.
Did you see that?
Hey, no fair.
You're making a mockery of the breakdown lane.
Why is there such a big fence, Dad?
Well, millions of people come to America in search of a better life, and we've decided we don't need that many.
Did the super-newson phones come through the fence?
No, Bobby.
Khan applied the legal way.
Sometimes the system fails us.
Hey, check out this dangerous character.
Ooh, watch out!
You think he's running guns?
Sir, pull your vehicle over to the inspection area, please.
He was joking.
Tell him you were joking, Con.
I let him look.
You got nothing to hide.
See you at condo.
Don't steal the towels.
You take, I charge.
This is a mini bar.
You use, you pay.
Now for the tour of the condo.
Condo.
Wait a minute.
Where are the rest of it?
I paid for me taught condo two floors.
This condo plenty me taught, but only one floor.
What are you trying to pull?
Obey and switch?
Me tad.
Me tad means half.
Just downstairs, not upstairs.
I comprendes?
Just downstairs?
I can't spend whole weekends squeeze side by side with a redneck neighbor.
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about any redneck neighbor.
Nobody's rented the upstairs.
It's completely vacant.
But where are the bathroom?
Oh, there's only one bathroom.
But hey, the tub is big enough for two people.
I come to see Mexico, not Hank Hill squeezing this year's butt into last year's swimsuit.
Oh no, you're not getting the upstairs, not after what you did to me back there at the border.
Okay, you take high class penthouse with a view, we take downstairs hovel.
Here's key.
Lock little sticky.
You gotta rake it like this.
No tomorrow.
This is a car key.
Yeah, you win new car.
This big game show.
Just rake it, stupid.
Well, it probably just needs a little WD-40.
Peggy, which bag has our bathroom stuff?
Come on, kids.
And a lie.
We're off to the paper mache district.
We gotta sneak off on our own, Bobby.
Mom, can Connie and I go play volleyball?
Well, all right, just make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen, honey.
We are much closer to the sun here than in Texas.
Ugh, this market is way too tacky.
They are not gonna have paper mache bears.
Oh my god!
La Leite de So!
The illegal beauty secret of the stars?
Look, Bobby.
Firecrackers.
Wee!
Bueno, M80s, those are a quarter stick of dynamite.
Oh my gosh, la bomba.
Those can blow your whole arm off.
Ahora regresamos a los días y las noches de Monsignor Martínez.
Vaya, con Dios.
Hey, don't take that away.
Ugh!
Hey!
This is a beer!
Not a fruit salad!
Why can't you find your own bar?
I have the same coupon book as you!
I just want a beer!
This is free country!
Isn't it?
Huh?
Oh, no!
No, I don't want this!
No!
No, look, if you want to make money, play for that guy!
He's rich!
Mucho dinnero!
Let's go!
What?
Oh, no, no.
You think I'm a sucker?
You sing for me, I sing for you.
That's what I like about you.
You really know how to dance.
Yeah.
How about that trash can over there?
Let's blow that up.
If this were a cherry bomb, I'd say yes.
But this is La Bamba.
Hmm.
This is our chance to really make a statement.
She blinded me with science.
She blinded me with science.
Pretty good job, Conn.
I've never heard that song with only one note before.
Yeah, in all about rhythm.
Bartender, two cervezas, por favor.
These are all authentic, locally crafted masks.
In our culture, they have deep social and religious importance.
Yeah, that's nice.
Have you got pears?
Right.
You're here for the paper mache pair.
Uh-huh.
Well, the pears are not sold separately.
Oh, it's perfect.
Oh, Muchos, Muchos Gracious.
I'm not even gonna haggle.
I have to pay for the frog, right?
Yes.
Of course.
It is so beautiful.
I really, I don't know how I can thank you.
Senora, I have a friend just across the border.
And I don't trust the mail.
The address is on the box.
Would you deliver it for me?
That would be my pleasure, amigo.
Gracias.
Oh, my, it's wrapped prettily, isn't it?
I wonder, what is in it?
I'll tell you what's in there.
A cocaine black top, PCP, you name it.
I see 2020 special all about this.
You're a mure, Peggy Hill.
Hank?
Hank Hill?
Is that you?
Dale?
What are you doing here?
I was just out for a drive.
Thought this place might have clean facilities.
Talk about a coincidence.
It's a nine hour drive, Dale.
Is it?
I guess I better stay then.
I think it's a dud.
Yeah.
Let's give her 15 more minutes.
Hey, you, you skinny gringo.
I don't know you.
Are you a guest?
I'm staying with the hills in 5B.
5B?
Upstairs?
Damn turistas, you try to rip me off.
It'll be the last time you... Somebody missed his siesta.
Boy, now I know why they call it Beach Volleyball.
Volleyball is really fun.
Bobby, come here.
Honey, do you think I'm naive?
no am i just a fool who believes whatever i am told i'm sorry why on earth did i trust that man that there could be anything in this package anything i am so estepido oh they had to kill 10 turtles to fill one little jar
Oh my god, it's the police!
They know I tried to blow up one of their monuments.
No, no, they think I'm a makeup smuggler.
Get out of my way.
We all have to put on lots of makeup.
This tastes like turtles.
What in the heck is going on?
I was never here.
Peggy Hill is nobody's meal.
A pair?
Come on out here, everyone.
Come on.
Get out here.
We have nothing to hide.
You will pay the condo manager 8,000 pesos.
But if the key fit, you must acquit.
10,000 pesos.
Bailiff confiscate their identification.
Look, let's just pay the money and go home.
Well, my money not fluid.
Take weeks to raise funds.
You pay, I owe you.
I can't cover it.
If I could just get back to Arlen, I could have him garnish my wages.
But we can't leave the country.
They took our ID.
Are you kidding?
We won't have any trouble driving right through that checkpoint.
They'll just wave us through pretty as you please.
Really?
Well, hankin' me, cause we're Angloid.
You, they'll haul out and give the third degree.
Maybe it'll be safer if we all split up.
Dale, you come with me.
Con, you're on your own.
Hey, Hill, you can't leave me.
We Americans hank.
No limin' on our bill, remember?
And we should set those mariachi's running.
Help me hank.
Y'all get going now.
Dale Kahn and I'll be along after we, uh, clear up that little misunderstanding.
I don't think it's such a good idea.
Yeah, well, here's another idea.
We go on without you.
Okay, alright.
I get in.
Hot hole!
Now just follow my lead and play it cool.
What if they find Khan?
If I know my Mexican legal system, which I do, we'll get about 15 years of the starvation diet of moldy bread and warm water.
Distilled water?
Oh, no.
And of course, there is a total lack of toilet paper and privacy.
Oh, God, I can't go while people watch.
Then let me do the talking.
Good morning.
Where are you gentlemen from?
Arlen, Texas.
I've been to Arlen.
Nice town.
Run!
I think we lost him.
We'll be okay.
Okay, we're screwed.
No, we're American.
We gotta find a pay phone and hope Ross Perot's 800 numbers still working.
Why you want to call that not for?
More to right there.
Means that people cross over every day.
We can't do no big deal.
Illegally?
No.
America is my country and I love her.
I wouldn't enter her in any way that's unnatural.
We have no choice, Hank.
The INS had their cameras trained on us.
The border guards think we're smugglers.
I'm too pretty to go to jail.
Uh, excuse me, uh, what did it cost you to rent those mopeds?
Uh, actually we own these, but we are looking to sell them.
Well, maybe we can help each other out.
Only thing is, we're a little short on cash.
That watch belonged to my grandfather.
That was my only pair of button fly jeans.
Hey, what, what happened to our mopeds?
Hey, look at me!
Yeah, look at me!
Somebody look at me!
Did you see?
Yeah, Dale.
You looked really cool.
For your next trick, why don't I kick your ass?
Get on the back, Con Dale.
You're lucky, Pierre.
Oh, man.
be fast if we walk oh did you see did you see uh have we just been captured
Wait Hank, I can't swim.
Of course you can't.
Look at a mighty river.
So much beauty, so much power.
Humble the man, Hank.
Where are you good friend, Hank?
Your friend's your base on the truth.
I broke it atop condo on purpose.
And I'm sorry.
What?
Damn you, Con.
This whole thing is your fault.
I thought you said you couldn't swim.
Yeah!
I beat that liar!
This river is filthy.
Look at this underwear floating around.
Hank, a little help here.
He won't last two days in the U.S.
America.
Texas.
Home.
Look how easy it is to get into this country.
I can't believe I had to learn a Bill of Rights.
When am I going to use that?
You'd be surprised, Conn.
I take the fifth on a daily basis.
Hurry up, Hank.
The border guards are coming.
You gotta give me a hand.
Dale?
Dale!
Dale, wait!
I can't do it alone!
People gone!
Take my hand!
Welcome to land of opportunity, Hank.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
You know what's funny?
This time, I own Texas soil first.
Ha!
He's the immigrant.
I smuggle him in.
Very funny, Con.
Hey, I live next door to Alien.
My property worth nothing now.
Ha-ha.
You get in a baby way.
I had to memorize all presidents.
You couldn't do it.
That stretch between poke and a blue can to wipe you out.
You ever hear of Garfield?
He more than a cartoon cat, you know.
He's part of history of my country.
Music playing
Vaya con Dios.
