1
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:29,358
Yep.

2
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,062
Yep.

3
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:34,906
Yep.

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,573
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:40,775
You know what it could be.

6
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,079
That damn starter motor.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,242
You're getting good compression.

8
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:46,323
Yeah.

9
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,428
I know what's wrong with it.

10
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:50,830
It's a Ford.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,955
You know what they say Ford stands for, don't you?

12
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:56,599
It stands for fix it again, Tony.

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,703
You're thinking of a fiat, Dale.

14
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,251
Fix it again.

15
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:15,617
I'll tell you what you do, you just take them dang old spark plugs out, and then that little hole, you just put a little hole around there, just like Bobby Hunter says, I could go boom, boom, just like that.

16
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:19,975
Well, I wish it were that simple, Boomhauer.

17
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,598
But I'll tell you what my truck really needs.

18
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:23,919
Leadership.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,389
Detroit hadn't felt any real pride since George Bush went to Japan and vomited on their auto executives.

20
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:32,950
Who's ready?

21
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,419
Y'all catch a Seinfeld show last night?

22
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,691
Yep.

23
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,033
Oh, hell, I missed it.

24
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:50,544
I'll tell you what, you see that part where Daniel George come in there and talk about tasting his own burp and cream or come sliding in.

25
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:51,987
I always do that.

26
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,470
I'll tell you what, man.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,393
Them dang old New York boys.

28
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,378
Just to show about nothing.

29
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:34,059
Whatcha listenin' to, son?

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,782
I don't think you like it.

31
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:36,603
Well, why not?

32
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:39,166
I like this new generation of music.

33
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,313
Hello?

34
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,856
Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.

35
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:48,599
Where did you record this?

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,020
I bought it at the mall.

37
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,923
It's a funny phone jerks.

38
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,222
Let me tell you, Bobby.

39
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,745
There's nothing funny about these sounds.

40
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:59,969
What that person on your tape has is a medical disorder.

41
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:02,211
Now, you get ready for the game, okay?

42
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:03,532
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,674
That boy ain't right.

44
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:08,857
Oh, God!

45
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,039
Luanne, I thought you went home.

46
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:13,662
No, Uncle Hank, Mom and Dad are still fighting.

47
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:18,706
Well, you're welcome to stay, but for God's sakes, girl, lock the door.

48
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,589
I've got a minor son living in this house.

49
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:27,638
So you ready to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?

50
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,681
Okay.

51
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,224
Nah, don't you worry son.

52
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:32,506
You just do your best.

53
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,269
Don't listen to her, Bobby.

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,356
If you want to win, you're gonna have to do better than your best.

55
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,959
How do I do that?

56
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,521
You gotta give 110%.

57
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:45,668
That's what'll give you that winning edge.

58
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:49,635
But what if the Wildcats give 110% too?

59
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,737
Well then you gotta try even harder.

60
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,339
How about if Bobby gave a hundred and twelve percent?

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,041
Uh, sure, that'd work.

62
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,364
Or maybe a hundred and thirteen.

63
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,507
Yeah, yeah, that's even better.

64
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:06,210
No, I don't know, thirteen is a very unlucky number.

65
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,593
Look, we're not talking about thirteen.

66
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:14,718
We're talking about a hundred and thirteen and even... Okay, give a hundred and twelve.

67
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:15,699
What's the difference?

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,762
Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?

69
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:22,958
Swing, Bobby!

70
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:23,398
Swing!

71
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,079
Swing!

72
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,163
And y'all the dang ol' dick lone apt at ball one.

73
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,545
Good eye, honey, good eye.

74
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,928
Oh, for crying out loud.

75
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:40,158
Bobby, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs and you can't get on base without taking a swing.

76
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,581
The pitcher could walk me, couldn't he?

77
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,524
Don't play lawyer ball, son.

78
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:47,787
Now you hit the next one out of the park.

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,762
Look at the batter, boy.

80
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,104
Watch the ball.

81
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:02,865
Huh?

82
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:04,147
What?

83
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:05,869
Hey, don't look at me.

84
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,752
Keep your eye on the ball.

85
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,854
Keep my eye on the what?

86
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,376
Stop looking at me, boy.

87
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:12,478
Watch the ball.

88
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,960
Can't hear you, Dad.

89
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,467
Don't worry, Bobby.

90
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,529
You played a good game.

91
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,717
I got to stop in here for a minute and get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.

92
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,154
I hate this place.

93
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,259
Excuse me, where's the hardware department?

94
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,184
Where is the hardware department?

95
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,687
What exactly is it you're looking for?

96
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,449
The hardware department.

97
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,313
Yeah, but are you looking for like a tool or something?

98
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,076
What difference does it make?

99
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,580
Huh, what difference does it make?

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,185
Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die and some WD-40.

101
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,526
Huh.

102
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:01,747
What is it that you're trying to do?

103
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:08,577
I'm trying to buy a tap and die and some WD-40 and get out of this God-forsaken store.

104
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,199
Ah.

105
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,260
And what is it, tap and die?

106
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,402
Okay, forget it.

107
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:14,345
Let's say I want a hammer.

108
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:16,107
Do you know what a hammer is?

109
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,349
That's what I want.

110
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:18,450
A damned hammer.

111
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:21,274
Now where in the hell would I go?

112
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:24,323
Hey, that's that Hank Hill fella that lives on the block next to us.

113
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,606
He sure has a temper, doesn't he?

114
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:26,388
Sure does.

115
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,695
Makes you wonder who gave his boy that black eye.

116
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,164
Uh, you're gonna have to pay for that, dude.

117
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:33,508
You're fired!

118
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:45,233
You say he hit his son with a bat?

119
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:54,343
No, that is definitely not acceptable.

120
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:59,489
I wish I could, ma'am, but the regulations say we can't take custody of the boy without an interview.

121
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,132
Don't you worry, he's in the system now.

122
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:03,934
I am on my way.

123
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:10,387
Hey, I know what's wrong with your truck.

124
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:13,191
It's your quote-unquote pollution controls.

125
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,834
I heard on talk radio you don't even need them.

126
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:18,236
They're just an egghead government plot.

127
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:21,780
How is cutting down on pollution a government plot, Dale?

128
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,522
Open up your eyes, man.

129
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,965
They're trying to control global warming.

130
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:26,546
Get it?

131
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,128
Global.

132
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,090
So what?

133
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,516
That's code for UN commissars telling Americans what temperature it's going to be in our outdoors.

134
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:40,662
I say let the world warm up, see what Boutros Boutros golly golly thinks about that.

135
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,205
We'll grow oranges in Alaska.

136
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:45,528
Dale, you giblet head.

137
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:46,930
We live in Texas.

138
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,157
It's already 110 in the summer, and if it gets one degree hotter, I'm going to kick your ass.

139
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:58,423
What in God's name is that thumping sound?

140
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,533
Bobby, why don't you go out and help your daddy?

141
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,979
You have been watching way too much TV, son.

142
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:05,322
Come on.

143
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,686
Come on, Bobby, up.

144
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:07,407
No more TV.

145
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:08,390
Turn it off now.

146
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,322
Oh, God, I love that poor man.

147
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:14,444
Oh!

148
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,050
There.

149
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,133
That's better.

150
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:28,860
Hello, I'm a social worker with the state.

151
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,042
Would you mind if I talk to you for a minute?

152
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:32,183
Well sure, come on in.

153
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,246
Dammit, there it is again.

154
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,609
Where is that thumping coming from?

155
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,210
It's driving me crazy.

156
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:41,833
Could be far off helicopters.

157
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:44,816
You in helicopters.

158
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,017
Dale, what are you doing?

159
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:46,878
Give me some light!

160
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,860
Now, I can't see!

161
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,483
My arm!

162
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:51,663
My head!

163
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:53,064
Ow!

164
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,967
Ow!

165
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,008
Mrs. Hill, would you say your husband has a bad temper?

166
00:08:59,228 --> 00:08:59,869
Who, Hank?

167
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,512
No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.

168
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,498
No more bouncing that ball!

169
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,300
Hank, we have a visitor.

170
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:18,611
So your assertion, Mr. Hill, is that Bobby got the black eye at his baseball game?

171
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,733
That's not my assertion.

172
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:21,874
That's what happened.

173
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,077
Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill?

174
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:24,958
No.

175
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,050
What the heck are you writing?

176
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:31,273
All you got to write is one word.

177
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:31,694
No!

178
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:35,399
Mr. Hill, I feel that you're coming from an anger mindset.

179
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:42,528
And if you're projecting this anger onto me, it gives me grave concerns as to how you facilitate your son's growth in private.

180
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:46,534
Mr. I have not begun to project my anger onto you.

181
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,678
Mrs. Hill, how did you get this here on your forehead?

182
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:50,479
Oh, this?

183
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,921
Well, Bobby threw his baseball at you.

184
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,823
You threw a baseball at your mother?

185
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,806
Oh, Hank, it was an accident.

186
00:09:56,883 --> 00:10:00,048
So would this be the same baseball that gave Bobby the black eye?

187
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:04,875
Uh, Dale, you sure you want to be messing with Hank's truck when he's not around?

188
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:07,318
I'm gonna help get him this alternator off.

189
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,644
Uh, Dale, I think you released the brake cable.

190
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:12,766
Dale!

191
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:16,471
No, I didn't.

192
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,973
I guess I better get going.

193
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,477
I got some edging to do.

194
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,643
Do you work outside the home, Mrs. Hill?

195
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:25,764
Well, yes, I do.

196
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,566
I'm a substitute Spanish teacher.

197
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,669
Losestudiantes son, me saw me ghost.

198
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,230
And you just have the one son?

199
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:32,851
Uh-huh.

200
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,975
Yeah, well, we would have liked to have more kids, but Hank has a narrow urethra.

201
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:38,496
Peggy.

202
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,358
In fact, Hank's sperm can.

203
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,098
That's enough.

204
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,841
What in the hell did you tell him that for?

205
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,062
Well, he asked me.

206
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:47,204
He asked you how many kids we have.

207
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,146
He didn't ask you about my glands.

208
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,567
Please, Mr. Hill.

209
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,029
Loud is not allowed.

210
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:53,410
What?

211
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,474
Loud is not allowed.

212
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,278
Now you listen to me, mister.

213
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,550
I work for a living, and I mean real work not writing down gobbledygook.

214
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:08,723
I provide the people of this community with propane and propane accessories.

215
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:26,664
Oh, when I think of all my hard-earned tax dollars, going to pay a bunch of little twig boy bureaucrats like you, it just makes me wanna... Oh, God, it just... Honey, bring me my BC headache powder and a glass of water.

216
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:27,927
All right, Hank.

217
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,546
Now you listen here.

218
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,108
You see that boy?

219
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:32,649
That's my boy.

220
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:39,377
And if you ever try to take him away, so help me, God, I'll tear you a new one bigger than the Grand Canyon.

221
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,700
Now I want you to get out of my house.

222
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,802
You're not welcome here.

223
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:47,085
I mean now, before I give you a black eye.

224
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:53,813
Get... You wanna know about ol' Hank?

225
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,036
Well, Hank's got a lot of problems.

226
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,221
Hey, baby!

227
00:11:58,622 --> 00:11:59,963
How about a couple of beers?

228
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:01,285
Sorry, should.

229
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:01,866
Gotta go.

230
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:04,069
I got another migraine treatment with John Redcorn.

231
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:09,716
Nancy, you've been going to that healer for 12 years and you still get headaches every night.

232
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,659
Healing process takes time, honey.

233
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:18,467
Getting back to the Hill family, have you ever seen Hank hit his child, Bobby?

234
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:19,088
Hank?

235
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:20,190
No, sir.

236
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,972
Bobby's his pride and joy.

237
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:25,116
Cause of his narrow urethra.

238
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:27,438
Are you absolutely sure?

239
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,380
100%.

240
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:29,924
You can ask my son.

241
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:31,568
He's Bobby's best friend.

242
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:32,730
Joseph!

243
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:34,294
What is it, Daddy?

244
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,339
You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?

245
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,763
No, I never.

246
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:38,545
See?

247
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,552
Now you can just move along now.

248
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:44,315
I've been calling y'all people for better than a month now.

249
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:46,918
Grabbed a shower every time a dangled dog crossed the street.

250
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,081
Started y'all 24 hours a day, and nobody answered.

251
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:52,984
You had called, asked if I was supposed to come out and do anything about that dog.

252
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:57,569
If you're just gonna get a dangled computer, ain't gonna come over here and shut that dangled dog up.

253
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,973
And then some weirdo came over and was asking us a bunch of questions.

254
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,194
Yeah.

255
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,217
He asked me if your dad ever whooped you.

256
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:06,698
He hasn't, right?

257
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,859
Of course not.

258
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:08,940
You know my dad.

259
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,662
He's all bark.

260
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,635
Boy, that guy got him mad, though.

261
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:19,805
My dad was like, get out of my house, my boy ain't much, but he's all I got.

262
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:23,369
He did great impressions.

263
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,971
Let me try.

264
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:28,075
I'll tear you a new one.

265
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:36,266
When I get my hands on you, you little pea brain, I'll bust your butt into little pieces.

266
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,168
Oh, I knew it.

267
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:42,286
Good God, Peggy, this was on the road and track.

268
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:43,727
Luann!

269
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,929
Luann, honey, can we talk to you?

270
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,051
Wait, wait, not while I'm here.

271
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,653
Mama's in jail.

272
00:13:51,234 --> 00:14:00,903
She was saving a quart of beer for before bed, and daddy threw it out, and she went after him with a fork, and the trailer tipped over, and everything went upside down, and it's all gonna be on real stories of the Highway Patrol.

273
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:05,267
And the wig I styled for Beauty Academy is ruined.

274
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,610
What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?

275
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,690
There, there.

276
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:18,740
You can stay with us till your mama comes home and you'll style a new wig better than before.

277
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,483
I'll let you use my tools.

278
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,447
Oh, thanks, Uncle Hank.

279
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:27,671
She has got to go.

280
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:31,655
Bobby?

281
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:33,157
Bobby, are you all right?

282
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:33,858
Come on out.

283
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,901
I thought I told you to get lost.

284
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,062
Come on, Bobby.

285
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,515
I can put you with a nice foster family in North Ireland where you can develop healthy life adaptations.

286
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,097
And they've got a pool!

287
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:45,999
Honey, let's give him Lou Ann.

288
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,042
Hey, I got a girl in here you can take right now.

289
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,624
Don't you want to live in a house with a pool?

290
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:52,605
No.

291
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:53,987
See, twig boy?

292
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,870
Now get your skinny butt off of my property.

293
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,433
Bobby, I know you can't talk in front of him.

294
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:01,494
I said get!

295
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:02,255
Get!

296
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,236
Get out of here!

297
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,278
You are out of control!

298
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,200
You're out of control, twiggy!

299
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,308
Thanks for the latte, Kenneth.

300
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,171
Anthony, could I see you a minute?

301
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,573
It's on this Hill family case.

302
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:23,539
You couldn't confirm any actual abuse, but you still recommended the state take custody?

303
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, yeah.

304
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,582
I mean, the whole neighborhood was Redneck City.

305
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,926
Did you see in the report how he dented my G.O.?

306
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:30,607
Redneck City.

307
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:31,548
That's pretty funny.

308
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:32,990
Where are you from, son?

309
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,951
Los Angeles.

310
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:35,112
Hmm.

311
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,154
And see here, hit by baseball.

312
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,503
So, how did you like old Harvey?

313
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:44,628
Who's Harvey?

314
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,251
Oh, he's a little league coach.

315
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:49,658
You did talk to the little league coach, didn't you?

316
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,233
Son, have you lost your mind?

317
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:58,574
Wait!

318
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:02,078
Dad, you're not supposed to yell at me anymore.

319
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:09,387
The guy from the state said, your hostility invalidates our parent-child contract.

320
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,910
You're quoting that twig boy at me?

321
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,252
Hi, the neighbors.

322
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:18,759
Remember, he said loud is not allowed, Dad, or they'll take me away.

323
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:21,602
Oh, God.

324
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:27,449
Hello?

325
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:28,830
Is this the Hill residence?

326
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:30,252
Who am I talking to?

327
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,513
Bobby Hill.

328
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,276
Well, son, this is the state social services.

329
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,839
We're calling off our investigation of your father.

330
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,983
The workers that visited you will be leaving the office and going back to LA.

331
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,847
Now, you please tell your parents we apologize for the misunderstanding.

332
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,429
OK, I'll tell them.

333
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:47,230
Bye.

334
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,692
Bobby, who was that?

335
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:54,998
Uh, wrong number.

336
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:10,949
I borrowed your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.

337
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:14,232
It wouldn't start at first because you had a clogged fuel line, but I have a little bit clean.

338
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:20,959
Hey Bobby, go plug this in the garage for me.

339
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,200
Okay.

340
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,664
Wanna see something cool?

341
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:33,783
What in the heck?

342
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,145
Don't you see I'm working here?

343
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,386
Close the dang door!

344
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:39,029
Bob, just keep put!

345
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:39,369
Stop!

346
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:40,751
Stop hitting that button!

347
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:41,772
Give me that thing!

348
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:46,237
Dad, that's not respectful adult child growth dialogue.

349
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:51,142
I'll give you dialogue that's not coming from a center of anger.

350
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:56,989
Please return the garage door to its factory preset down position.

351
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,654
That is cool.

352
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:13,710
Please, uh, respect my fences right to be a fence.

353
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:31,793
Now!

354
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:37,871
What on God's green earth are you making those noises for?

355
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,233
There's sound effects.

356
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,155
Like that guy in police academy.

357
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,097
That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up.

358
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:43,878
I decided.

359
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:46,020
And dad can't say boo about it.

360
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,984
Bobby, a man from the Child Protective Services just came by.

361
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:55,090
Now, he said that he told you last week that this investigation was off.

362
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:59,234
Oh, please don't tell dad.

363
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:00,776
Well son, I have to.

364
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:01,797
He's been worried.

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,784
But I like him better this way.

366
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:04,726
How come?

367
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,754
I can make him love me even when I screw up.

368
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:09,899
Is that what you think?

369
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,991
It's hard, Peggy.

370
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,482
I don't want to lose my little boy, my only son.

371
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:20,985
But, oh, it's hard.

372
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:22,827
Well, you can relax.

373
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:25,511
The investigation has been off for a week.

374
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,714
Only Bobby didn't tell us.

375
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:28,676
I'll kill him!

376
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,018
All right, calm down, honey.

377
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:30,979
Now, let me explain.

378
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,822
He didn't do it to be mean.

379
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:36,007
Bobby honestly doesn't think that you love him all the time.

380
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,048
That's crazy.

381
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:37,829
Of course I love him.

382
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,671
Very good.

383
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,373
Now, say it to Bobby.

384
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:41,539
What are you talking about?

385
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,584
I want you to tell Bobby that your love for him is unconditional.

386
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,165
Well, I can't say that.

387
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:48,207
I can't.

388
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,509
You know how I was raised.

389
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,311
What my father's like.

390
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:56,436
I got my shin blown off by a Japan man's machine gun.

391
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:01,141
So don't come crying to me with your problems.

392
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,443
Honey, I'm begging you.

393
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,965
For the sake of this family, you have got to do it.

394
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,288
He's waiting for you out on the porch.

395
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:08,644
Oh, jeez.

396
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:28,753
That twig boy comes over here and gets... Uh... You, uh... You're my son, uh... Well, you know, with everything, uh... That entails, uh... Uh...

397
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:39,062
You know, feelings of fondness and more... You know what I mean, don't you boy?

398
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:40,424
No.

399
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:46,793
Well, that's a hell of a weird sound.

400
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,914
I never made that before.

401
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,983
You... family.

402
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,010
You're not making this easy on me, boy.

403
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,405
Okay.

404
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,706
I love you no matter what you do there.

405
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:04,167
Phew.

406
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:05,969
Let's go get something to eat.

407
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,954
I'm not just a big disappointment to you.

408
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:13,077
Disappointment?

409
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,719
No, you make me proud.

410
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,984
I've been disappointed by just about everything else in this town, but you?

411
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:20,205
Not once.

412
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,409
Damn it, you're my boy.

413
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,610
You know better than that.

414
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,788
He punched him!

415
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:28,130
I knew it!

416
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:28,754
I told him!

417
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:29,700
Did you see that?

418
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,331
See what, big boy?

419
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,283
Never mind.
