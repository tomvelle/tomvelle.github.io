I can't stand it anymore.
I'm gonna grab that violin from Connie and smash it against the fire hydrant.
Bill, she started four and a half beers ago.
She can't possibly go on much longer.
Please, Lord, give her a cramp, if it's thy will.
Ow.
What you doing, Hank?
Go into the crossroads to sell your soul?
No.
I just thought we might want a musical change of pace in the alley.
Now I want to hear Puff the Magic Dragon play that when I like it.
Play it.
Puff the Magic Dragon live by the sea.
Bill, do you have any idea what that song is about?
It's about a dragon.
We're a grown man.
Here, how about...
The magic dragon lived by the sea.
Uh-oh.
Party's over, Hank.
It's the music police, a.k.a.
Little Miss Bummer.
Don't stop.
I like it.
The only time I heard music like that was at Disney World when we passed the Country Bear Jamboree.
But my dad pushed me into the Hall of Presidents.
Could you play it again?
Um, well, sure.
Well, all right then.
Wow.
This violin did that?
When you're playing bluegrass, you call it a fiddle, Connie.
violin
Ah, I gotta go.
My dad has this joke.
How do you get into the Van Clyburn Summer Orchestra?
Practice.
Well, it used to be a joke.
Now he just screams it.
Who's Van Clyburn?
Texas' own Van Clyburn is a classical pianist with a bustling summer camp in Fort Worth.
We share a birthday.
Khan's making her play classical, but the girl's got a natural talent for bluegrass.
Everybody in the alley thought so, and you know Boomhauer is a music snob.
Well, the strange thing is, people with that much talent rarely amount to anything.
Interesting fact, Connie and I always had a dream of playing Carnegie Hall to showcase our talents.
I'd open with a tight 40-minute set of observational comedy and poo jokes, and then she'd close with a violin concerto for the blue hairs.
Uh-huh.
But I think fiddling could take Connie even further than Carnegie Hall.
That's if she grows up pretty enough.
Those Dixie Chicks have really raised the bar.
Okay, very good.
Much better.
Take a break from your Mozart.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
And while you're relaxing, you will read about Mozart.
Learn about the man.
Get inside his head.
Any child prodigy can play.
But you only one who will know what it really means.
Okay, yeah.
How about this level at a yard sale?
I'm afraid the price was too good to be true.
Test it on my stomach.
It's flat as a pancake.
Eh?
Hey, Mr. Hill.
My dad won't be back for an hour.
He's getting his hair dyed.
I wasn't supposed to tell anybody that.
You want to throw down with a hoedown?
I'll get my guitar.
I'll get my washboard.
I'll go get my string bass, which is really a keyboard.
Hey, man, I'm going to go grab my banjo.
Maybe don't go getting that little accordion, man.
What do you think?
No.
No, no, no, banjo, man.
Let's go.
One, two, three.
Hey yo man, I'm gonna take a brush right now.
Bobby, put that down.
That's the jug I keep stuff in.
Saw that thing, Connie?
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to get into it.
No, no, it's my fault, Connie.
I told you to saw.
So you're just going to restring it, huh?
I told her to throw it out.
Well, this little girl doesn't look like she could hold a fiddle let alone break a string.
Hey, how about a little twinkle twinkle?
Oh, she's good.
You ever think about taking her to Branson?
You think she's Branson good?
Well, hell yeah.
They got these fiddle contests there.
I used to judge them till they found out I was taking bribes.
Boy, the best players in the world go to Branson.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Could I wear a sundress and play in my bare feet?
Heck, I might kick off my shoes and join you.
And we could be your backup band, the Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience.
Hmm.
I like it.
Aw, no.
I'm gonna be in Fort Worthless that weekend auditioning for Van Boring.
Ah, well, that's a kick in the teeth.
Bobby!
Okay.
Blue moon at the touch keep on shining.
What is that noise you're making?
It sounds like you're killing a seagull with a bad pipe.
It's bluegrass, Con.
Music made in America.
And whether you like it or not, your daughter's a natural.
And I'm having more fun than a dog up a bone tree.
That's how you say it's fun in bluegrass.
That inbred music is designed so only people with six fingers can play it.
Your path is then Clyburn Camp, to Harvard, to New York Philharmonic, not hay wagon to hee-haw.
Time to pack!
We love you, honey!
Phone as soon as you get to host family in Fort Worth.
Remember to give them the pineapple!
Pack this on class!
Oh.
Mr. Hill?
My dad said I could go to Branson.
How fast do you think you can get the Dale Gribble bluegrass experience back together?
probably after they finish their beers.
Hey guys, don't open a new one.
We're going to Branson.
Come on, Dale, you don't need two suitcases.
They're my jumpsuits.
That's what the people come to see.
Bobby, I can't babysit you and Bill, and he's in the band.
Bill, spit that out.
I'm coming with you.
Yakov Smirnoff is in Branson, and he's a stepping stone to my comedy-writing future.
All right.
But you better sleep the whole way.
We'll be careful.
What do I care?
Hi, Dad.
Fort Worth is great.
What's the competition like?
Is Tim Woo there?
Yeah, but he heard his hands stealing a Coke from the Coke machine.
Hey, Connie, is my tongue blue?
Who's that?
Uh, it's Tim Woo.
Uh, his tongue is blue.
Dad, I gotta go practice some more.
Yes, go practice.
Okay, Dad.
I love you.
Stop talking.
Go practice.
The key to writing a good Yaakov Smirnoff joke is picturing yourself arriving in America and noticing that it is different from Russia.
Yeah, and when Yaakov says, I reckon, and y'all in his accent, I just lose it.
It's brilliant, really.
The only thing brilliant really about Yakov Smirnoff is that he's a KGB spy.
He's been sending US secrets back to Mother Russia while tourists are seduced by his fake comedy act.
Although his beard is real.
Oh god!
All this joke will kill!
You wanna hear it?
No, not really.
The band needs to practice till we're perfect.
I don't wanna tarnish our reputation before we have one.
Okay, but first I want to hear the joke.
Here goes.
In America, you put in God we trust on your money.
In Russia, we have no money.
Hey, money, no.
Come on, focus.
Does anybody remember why we're going to Branson?
Fiddle contest!
And to have fun.
I mean, even in math camp, we played chess.
Yes, yes, we're going to have fun, but you know what's not fun?
Being ill-prepared.
Okay.
One, two, three, four.
All right, everybody cough up two bucks and we'll be officially entered.
No turning back now.
Hey, it's 10 to five.
You think it's too late to get seats for the five o'clock Yakov?
Yeah!
Well, maybe you can get Yakov to write you an autograph.
Dear Dale, hope the show was worth throwing away that young girl's musical career.
Yours truly, Yakov.
Can do, will do.
Come on, Connie.
Okay, Connie, just tell them you're not interested, so they'll drop it.
Well... See, she's not interested.
Where do we put the gift?
Mess up her bed and hide it underneath her pillow.
And when she comes home from audition, we'll scream at her, Kanjunya, clean up your filthy room!
And when she cleans it up, that's when she finds the LaMorge violin.
Bill Monroe, the foggy mountain boys?
Men, have you seen this pornography?
Don't worry.
She's in Fort Worth.
We throw it out before she gets back.
Wait a minute.
Tim Woo hates Coca-Cola!
Ah!
Connie's in Branson!
I've been learning English for 20 years.
Now I moved to the Ozarks, I had to start all over again.
Mel Tillis is teaching me English.
It's taking a lot longer than I expected.
Yakov Smirnov is not my real name.
It used to be Jack Daniels.
Mr. Smirnov, I would one day like to be a comedian like yourself.
I've written an in-America and in-Russia joke for you that I think is very funny.
Hey kid, I don't tell Russian jokes for last ten years.
Now I do jokes about relationships and things I observe.
I'll give you twenty dollars, American.
Keep them coming.
Why did you do that?
Save the sweet guy act for the tourist, Nikolai.
The CIA will be here momentarily.
I called them during the Statue of Liberty dance number.
Are you okay?
My left eye really burns.
He's faking it, Bobby.
It's all part of his act, which, by the way, is very funny.
There he is.
Security, we have a situation.
Nah!
Yakov was so funny, he should be the center square.
I'm so sick of whoopies.
Oh, and we got to meet him after the show.
Great guy.
Where have you guys been?
I've had to deal with the Bluegrass brothers all by myself.
They've been staring at me twiddling their beards and trying to psych me out.
Dad, I sold my joke to Yakov.
I'm a professional comedy writer.
Look, I told you to stay out of my wallet.
The Dale Gribble Bluegrass Experience?
Y'all after the Harris Twins, one holds the fiddle while the other holds the bow.
They're good.
Oh, God.
Well, this is it, Connie.
Your dream to become a professional bluegrass musician.
Don't blow it.
My dream?
Mr. Hill.
Come on, Connie, focus.
Rossing up your bow and focus.
No.
No more Rossin.
No more of your see-the-fiddle-be-the-fiddle rhetoric.
I don't want to be a professional bluegrass musician.
I quit.
And I quit, too.
Even though I'm not in the band.
What?
Where are you going?
The twins are finishing, Connie.
Well, I saw that coming.
Yet I did nothing to stop it.
Why do I fear success?
Maybe Connie ran off because of stage fright.
Okay.
I'm not afraid to say it.
We're a novelty band without Connie.
It's going to be fine.
You guys just stall the audience until I get her back.
Boomhower, you're good at stage pattern.
Yeah, ma'am, I'm going to give a little bit of an overload.
Hey, ma'am, how you doing in Branson, ma'am?
Let me hear you say yeah.
Good.
Perfect.
Do that.
You kidnapped my daughter and took her across state lines to play here, Billy, music against her will.
I've been looking for a reason to put you in jail, and now I have it.
What are you talking about?
You gave her permission to come with us.
Never!
I make sure she practiced Mozart, get into van Clyburn, then Ivy League Orchestra.
From there, she'd play Paris, Rome, then I'd take her back to my hometown of Luang Prabang, and stick it up their nose.
That's why she ran away from you.
She'd rather play bluegrass and win this contest and then get a record deal and open up the Connie Souffanoucin phone theater and... I'm a jackass.
Stop stating the obvious!
Where's my daughter?
I don't know.
I'm sure she's fine.
She's with Bobby.
Great!
That narrows it down.
Now all we have to do is check every free buffet in town.
How about this one?
I've been working out with weights.
Every time someone says, let's work out, I say, weight.
That's funny, Bobby.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm sick of our dads putting pressure on me.
At least they're paying attention.
Feels like I'm always playing to an empty house.
You know what I'd love to do?
Run away to the Appalachian Mountains and play bluegrass all day long with people who know that music is about having fun.
People who sing and smile even though they're poor and their faces are smudged with coal.
And I can wear overalls with no shirt and tell jokes about the high cost of mules.
Let's do it!
They'll grab a bluegrass experience.
You're up.
They're not here.
They're locked in the vault.
What?
Hold on.
Screw Connie, I got us an even better fiddle player.
May I present to you Mr. Charlie Daniels.
Where is this young fiddle player whose final wish was to meet me?
Well, actually you're too late, but her other final wish was that you would play with us her favorite song on that stage now.
So, what do I tell her parents?
Tell them I'll play to my fiddle catches fire.
Oh, we can't afford bus tickets.
We only have enough money for a t-shirt or a row of seats at the Andy Lam show.
Well, I could go for either, but it's up to you.
Bobby, we are going to be in Appalachia by sundown.
Why do we do it, Con?
Why do we push Connie so hard?
I do it because she has a lot of talent and I want what's best for her.
You do it.
Well, frankly, I'm flummox.
Back off, push Bobby.
He doesn't like sports.
He doesn't play an instrument.
There's nothing to push him into.
Yeah, he's gonna be a loser, all right.
Now, hold on.
Bobby's not a loser.
Say that again, and I'll pop you in the chops.
Okay, okay.
Won't hear Billy start swinging soon till the whole town join in.
For your information, a lot of people think Bobby's funny.
The kid's only 13 years old, and he's already sold a joke to this Yakov Smirnoff.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh...
In America, they put in God we trust on the money.
In Russia, they have no money.
That's funny!
I hate Russia!
Yeah.
Yeah, that is a good joke.
It's Branson good.
I bloom a wound, I work in a tucky, keep on shining.
Oh, damn you, Hank Hill.
I can't get that song out of my head.
Ah, here goes again.
I bloom a wound, I work in a tucky, I keep on shining.
She's playing on the streets for lousy tourists.
She should be playing at Royal Abadhaal for Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.
Oh, come on, Con.
I bet you never knew she could smile and play at the same time.
Shine on the one that's gone and let me bloom.
Maybe one day you can be our opening act.
Shine on the model mask on and say goodbye.

Use force if you need to.
Help, Charlie!
Bill, come on in!
Hmm.
I like it.
