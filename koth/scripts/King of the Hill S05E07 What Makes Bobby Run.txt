Oh, look!
Here's a few more pictures of a certain yearbook editor's boyfriend.
Look at this one of me with a french fry on my nose.
That's okay, Bobby.
I already have your class photo.
That's it?
But I'm a sure bet for class clown.
Shouldn't that get me some coverage?
The PTA said we can't do the eighth grade poll anymore.
What?
Why not?
Last year's worst dresser turned out to be really poor.
Class clown was my ticket to immortality.
Now I'm no different from any other kid.
I'm like a stew Harriet or a Mike Soto.
Actually, Mike is president of the Junior Volunteers Club.
So in 20 years, everyone will remember Mike Soto bowling with blind kids.
But Bobby Hill's talking tummy will be long forgotten.
Who's the justice?
Have you seen my duct tape?
Not the shiny silver, but the matte gray?
Hey, that's my old Landry Lantern.
Dad, do you realize your intent photo's not counting your class photo?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Hey, there's Cleave Worthington, and Don Postley, back when he had all his fingers, and Dub Taylor.
Well, he was the best mascot Ireland's ever had.
What a wild man.
And all the nicknames we had for him.
Daffy Dub, Rubba Dub Dub.
I guess those were the only two.
Dad, I was thinking of taking some blind kids bowling.
Bobby, that's not funny.
The bake sale was a big success, raising enough money to buy a new pewter baton for moi.
Give yourselves a big hand!
And hats off to Mike Soto for spearheading that.
That kid's a machine!
Mr. Grandi, you're looking at your next landry longhorn.
What makes you think you've got what it takes to wear the horns?
I'm a cut up.
I'm a clown.
I'll do anything for attention.
Remember?
That's why you kicked me out of chorus.
Triaths will be after school on Wednesday.
And I want all pep, no filler.
And remember, you'll be performing for a man who's seen a lot of pep in his day.
A lot.
My name is Bobby.
I like to party.
And if you don't believe me, watch me shake my body.
Bobby!
That mirror is for practicing golf swings in, not your prop comedy.
I'm coming up with stick for the Longhorn auditions.
You're going out for the Landry Longhorn?
So you're not prancing around the garage at all, you're training.
Yeah, but I need an angle, a hook, some kind of boffo gimmick to set me apart.
Well, how about your own set of horns?
I bet I could rig something up.
Dad, you would build me a prop?
In this case, son, yes I would.
The dang Microsofto, where does he find the time?
I'll give him this.
He is flexible.
This is really heating up.
Next victim, Bobby Hill.
Would you like Arlen fight, fight, fight, or we are the Landrymen fight, fight, fight?
Thank you, sir, but I brought my own tape.
Fine.
Boston.
Please, hold your applause.
It's humbly entry, middle school.
Yep.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Bell Doe Tree.
Hey!
I'm talking on it right now.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
That was Jimmy.
The guy who sold me the phone.
Way to go Bobby.
That's great way to go Bobby.
That's great Now we're both part of the Ireland football tradition long horns
And look at that, it's still got all the rips and tears.
Boy, you can almost hear all those years of McMainer Berry's whoop-ins.
This calls for a special dinner.
I'm gonna go tell your mother to make us a special dinner.
McMainer Berry whoop-in.
That's like whoop, whoop, whoop.
Right.
No, whooping, as in the big beat down, as in halftime hammering, as in the McMainerberry mascot massacre, as in... Am I missing something?
Whenever Arlen is winning, it's a tradition for the McMainerberry band to charge the longhorn and give him a pounded!
It's a real crowd-pleaser.
Yeah, man, did your dad used to like scoring the touchdown that got Dub Taylor pounded?
Really?
Uh, maybe McMainterberry will take an early lead and hold it for the rest of the game.
Yeah, maybe I'll file a federal income tax return.
That goes in my big book of So There's.
If I get a good action shot of you, I'm willing to dump the Model UN spread.
Who cares?
McManerberry's gonna kill me.
I'm a lover, not a... I'm not even a lover!
But then wheel that costume back down to Granny's office and tell him to find himself another punching bag.
Woman, I can't get out of this.
Imagine telling your dad you were quitting violin!
Ugh, I do.
All the time.
I hate that violin.
into the first quarter, McManerberry leads 10-7!
Go the little horn is safe for now!
Barry!
Barry!
McManer!
McManer!
Barry McManer!
Barry McManer Barry!
Barry McManer Barry!
Ain't tough, McManerberry!
Logo!
Cheer up, Keegan.
No shame in losing to a better team.
Hey, those McMain or Berry scrubs are going down, buddy.
You better get ready for a whooping.
Oh, yeah, totally.
I hope we beat them so bad I get two whoopens.
Yes.
One more, Arlen, touchdown.
Your boy gonna be pinata for marching band.
Man, is that gonna be sweet.
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, Conn.
Who is that taking pictures of your daughter, taking pictures of Bobby?
No one.
That's who.
Oh, oh, oh!
Call it back, Sneak!
Cut it with their pants down!
Ah!
Back down!
Arlen take lead!
Arlen take lead!
It's all good.
It's all good.
Oh Hank, tell me what's going on.
I can't, I can't watch.
Wait, no, no, this is some kind of comedy bit.
He's gonna turn around any second.
Maybe he's just going to the car to get a... Ah, he's gone.
I'm not surprised McMain or Barry won after that happened.
God, I needed to use the restroom, but I couldn't face the guys at the trough.
There he is.
Whether people were bowing or cheering, you got a reaction, and by golly, that's what counts.
They should call Bobby the lame horn.
What's he gonna do for the big game against Belton?
Show up in a chicken suit, bop, bop, begok.
I've got to take my mind off of this.
I'm going to treat myself to the hardware store.
Uh, Hank, quarterback Keegan Evans' dad runs the paint shaker.
Oh.
Oh, well, at least they toned it down.
On the bathroom wall, they went after my family.
Don't worry, Bobby.
Even with all the letters, I won't take your class picture out of the yearbook.
Nurse Janix?
Pick them up.
I said pick them up.
Bobby, I'm going to need you to turn in your keys and your horns.
My office, five minutes.
Horns!
I understand you're just a kid.
At the same time, what you did at the game was the most shameful act of cowardice I've ever seen.
Sir, please.
I was born to wear the horns.
You can't take them away from me.
I've got a plan, a great plan, and it's gonna work.
Yeah, what's the plan?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
It's a secret.
Well, I do love secrets.
You came to see me?
Hang on.
State your purpose.
Mr. Gribble, what would you say if I told you I am gonna steal the belt and armadillo tonight?
I would say you're a madman or a genius, maybe a little above.
I'll go 60-40.
I need someone who knows alarms and you've got the most in the neighborhood.
Ever since those swaggering Boucher brothers stole the armadillo back in 76, Belton's been keeping it under pretty tight security.
That middle school is impregnable.
Cannot be pregnated.
Except by me.
But I don't come cheap.
I don't have a lot of money.
Fine.
I'll come cheap.
You got five bucks?
I can get four.
I'm in.
Do you need any help?
With what?
It just seems that every time that Julia Roberts is on TV, it is only to yapp about our movie.
Well, I'm headed over to Keegan Evans' house.
Really?
But his dad said he hated you.
For what?
The run-in-away thing?
That's ancient history.
Some of the guys from the team are sleeping over, so you won't see me or hear from me until the game tomorrow.
Well, that's great.
Now, don't let him tease you too much.
Remember, you're the mascot, not the place kicker.
Hey, Dad, I was thinking.
Maybe you want to invite Dub Taylor to the game.
Dub, Taylor, are you sure?
I want you to hear from him that I'm the best mascot since he wore the horns.
Steady, steady.
What's going on?
I'm reading lips.
There's four kids in there and tough ones too.
Don't you have some poisons in your truck you can pump in there to make them fall asleep?
I do, but the amount of poison that can put four kids to sleep might also kill an armadillo.
And the kids might not wake up.
Well how are we gonna get the dillo away from four kids?
We're lucky.
According to the one they call... Dude.
There used to be eight guardians.
The other four went to steal the Longhorn costume.
Where they will run into what?
Two dozen of the baddest ass eighth graders protecting the costume?
But I didn't... Nobody said anything about... Please tell me you at least put up a maze of mirrors to thwart the would-be costume rustlers.
Broken glass?
Or a slick?
Piece of string?
Go go go.
You save the costume.
I'll find a parking space.
Go away!
The Longhorn is heavily guarded!
Oh, who's that?
Bobby Hill?
Oh come on guys, we better go.
Bill, it's Dale!
Guess who's got your cell phone?
Mr. Gribble!
How?
Be specific, Bobby.
I'm not a mind reader here.
They're breaking down the door!
Wait for me!
Why don't you just run away like you did at Mick Main or Barry?
Or you can stay and take the beating you missed out on.
What a coward.
It's too bad.
I wanted to give him a beating!
Yeah!
Peanut!
Get your peanuts!
I think I see Bobby!
Oh, wait.
No, no.
That's a smudge on my glasses.
Hank, look at this smudge.
It looks just like Bobby.
Hey, Daffy Dub!
Over here!
You old son of a gun, how was the drive?
This thinkin' crowd is dead!
What is this, goddamn Wimbledon?
Here we go, longhorns, here we go!
What I tell you about Doug... That he has a lot of pep.
That's right.
We are the Landry men!
Fight, fight, fight!
You got any face paint?
Uh, Peggy's got lipstick.
Oh my god!
It's Peggy Platter from West Arlen!
West Arlen sucks!
Well, isn't this ironic?
The best longhorn ever and the father of the worst longhorn ever!
I say that because Bobby was guarding the Longhorn costume last night, and some kids came to steal it, and he turned tail and ran.
That's impossible.
Bobby was sleeping over at Keegan Evans' house.
The sleepover was a cover story.
I was with him.
We were trying to steal the belt in Armadillo, and long story short, you raised a coward.
Oh, God.
Wait, you were with him?
Well, where is he?
Where's my baby boy?
Don't worry, Peggy.
He probably camped out in some bushes.
No, that takes guts.
He probably spent the night at Denny's.
I drove all the way from Pensacola for this?
I came here for a football game, not a soap opera.
Hey, Landry Losers, where's your wrong horn?
Our man's got socks!
That's it!
Let's get out of here before Dub gets back.
How many days is he staying with us?
Three.
Man, I didn't become a cheerleader to guard a trash can.
Ouch, ouch, ouch, foot asleep, foot asleep.
Okay, Mr. Crackers.
Nice and easy.
Nobody gets hurt.
If anyone yells, there's Bobby Hill's parents.
Just start to look around, saying, where, where?
Oh, no!
Security!
There you are.
Alright kid, step slowly towards me and surrender Mr. Crackers.
Yeah, that's right.
They'll whip you apart.
Bobby?
Bobby, hello, got the dillo.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Check it out.
Peggy Bobby's got Mr. Crackers.
Bobby's got Mr. Crackers.
Bobby's got Mr. Crackers.
Bite it.
Bite its face off.
Get in.
You can't catch this.
Hey Bobby Hill!
Long Horts!
Wonderful!
Alright Bobby, way to go!
Bobby just started a new tradition.
Now we have the McManer Berry Whoopin and the Belton Beating.
What a great time to be a Longhorn.
We are the Landry Man!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
