Yeah?
Don't cold can't mate.
Here you go.
RSVP means respondez-vous-ci-vous-play.
Which in redneck means pick up phone and call to give me headcount for big Laotian New Year's party.
New Year's party?
We're not fallin' for a New Year's party in April, Con.
We are not April fools.
You are dumb as chimps.
Laotians use lunar calendar so our new year come in April.
It's called Pimae.
So when do you pay your taxes?
August?
Okay, this real simple.
You all come to my big Pimae party, get out of your stinking pig pens for a night, see what it's like to live in a pottery barn catalog.
Huh.
So Khan's party is for real.
I'm an RSVP, I'm not going.
Nope.
No.
I'm going to make a PMI resolution to kiss you every day.
and to get out more.
Hi, Junior!
I better go.
If my dad sees us together, well, he thinks I'm collecting soil samples.
Your dad's days of hating me are coming to a close.
Who can hate a kid who can Charleston?
Bye.
Hank, we are going to that party.
They are Connie's parents, and it's not like there is a stream of girls lining up to date Bobby.
There is one.
Yeah, used to be none.
Exactly.
That is why we are going to do our part and pretend that we like Khan and Min.
Now, let's practice.
I'll be Khan.
You are a dumb redneck!
That sounds more like Min.
Leave my wife out of this hill, Billy.
I wish they'd move.
I'm not wearing that to the PMI party.
I don't know why you buy clothes for me online.
Wasana songs might come.
Chain Wasana Song is the biggest shank in our class.
They very important family.
Ted Wasana Song, member of Nine Rivers Country Club.
Hey, hey, hey!
I just get big call.
Ted Wasana Song.
Yes, they are coming to our party and Ted says they are bringing along important monks.
Buddhist monks?
Yeah, yeah, Buddhist, whatever, monks.
I'll get shrimp.
Yeah, big shrimp.
These monks are looking for reborn spirit of some lama, name of Lama Sanglug.
Listen on lama, but still spirit your big shot, any way you slice it.
They think he reincarnated in this area.
They look all over Macmanabary, turn up squat.
Ted says all signs point to chain.
You hear that, Connie?
Jane could be a llama, a great leader.
What makes everybody so sure that Jane is the llama?
He's second oboist, runner up in Westinghouse Science Contest, and he has terrific posture.
I'm first violin and a Westinghouse winner.
How do you know I'm not the llama?
Connie, a llama?
Oh, that'd be amazing.
Finally stuck up, jerk Ted was on his own, had to kiss my ass.
Hey Hank!
Bill?
Happy Pima!
Damn it, Bill!
Go ahead and get the Pima custom.
I'm in.
Oh gentle Christian neighbor as you might hear from my daughter sanglong ah I mean Connie ha ha where they come from they throw water on you to wash away the old year and bring luck for the new
Connie, Connie.
I saw Shane trying to suck up to the monks by wrapping up a to-go plate.
He is such a loser.
Talk to the Junior Monk.
He likes oceanography.
And who went to oceanography camp?
Me.
And Shane.
Hey, Con, I found one of your Heineken, sitting in the back of one of the crisper drawers.
Can I have it?
Oh, that not my beer.
I don't drink.
Min said it was yours.
Take it.
He village idiot, and in this village not really saying something.
And yet Connie, my daughter, still read to him.
Good luck trying to be a llama.
You don't have to try to be a llama.
You either are or you aren't, and I am.
Why would a llama want to come back as a third oboe?
Second, Connie.
Any would wind.
And when she little girl, she named her goldfish llama Soundglog.
We would like to lay out some artifacts for your daughter and the Wasana Songboy to observe.
If either child is the reincarnated llama, they will choose correctly.
Oh, yeah, the test!
I go get her!
I need the keys to the Aerostar.
Hey, yard sale.
How much for the bell?
No, this is a test.
One of these objects belonged to a revered lama before he died.
Sabaha.
His reborn spirit will recognize the object and choose it.
Oh, let me try.
How much is it?
Dollar or play?
OK, son.
You the llama.
You the llama.
Watch close.
Every monk has a tail.
Hurry, hurry.
You gotta pick before chin.
Ah, there.
It's great to see the kids and join a good old pee-pee-mal-pa-pa-an party.
Ah.
Outta my way, you redneck.
It's test time.
Hey, Puggy does do a good you.
Oh, no.
I'll stall her.
Hey, Chang!
What's the move with me?
Huh?
Bobby?
No, no, no, no, no.
Please get up.
I'm just the warm-up act.
Here's Connie to take the test.
Bobby, you just took the test.
Uh, no, I didn't.
Connie, here's your cane.
You have selected correctly.
That cane belonged to Sanglag.
Bobby, we believe you are a very special child.
Sunglag was also joyful and given to dance.
You could be destined to be a spiritual leader as the reincarnation of Lama Sunglag.
Okay, show's over.
We're going home.
This is all a big mistake.
You don't want me.
No, Bobby.
Today you passed a very important test.
Our leader, the Rin Porsche, will come here next Sunday to confirm our findings.
Look here.
I can't stop you from doing what you do at the airports, but in my neighborhood, you'll stay away from my son.
Thanks a lot, Bobby.
But I didn't do anything.
That guy in the dress is Nuku.
That guy is a monk and that dress is a robe and my religion is not a joke.
They are not taking this very well.
One of us should stay.
What?
What?
Aw, come on.
I'm not sleeping in that van another night.
No.
We are blessed to be in a town with the most generous Buddhist family.
Oh, good.
Company.
Flow of the air mattress.
Oh, and they thought it was gonna be Connie.
Well, I always knew my Bobby was destined for greatness.
To be perfectly honest, didn't see Lama.
The Buddhists think Bobby is a holy man.
Now that's just sad.
Hank, Hank, Hank, listen to this.
Richard Gere is a Buddhist.
Just keeps getting sadder.
Is this what you dragged me out here for?
Soft serve ice cream at the student union?
That was an unscheduled detour.
The campus Buddhist club is the main attraction.
Don't tell anyone I'm a llama.
I want to blend in.
This act symbolizes when the Buddha left his palace to become a monk and cut off his long hair with a sword.
My parents don't go to things like this.
There's no one here they want to meet.
Thanks for bringing me, Bobby.
Thank you for the ice cream cone.
A real lama wouldn't be thinking of supercut jokes in the middle of the ceremony, right?
Well, Lama Sanglang always said that the funniest joke comes from the tedium of meditation.
He was a wonderfully funny man.
He often wore his begging bowl like a hat.
I'd do that with my cereal bowl.
Bobby, there are some teachings that I think may help you on your journey.
Cool.
No pictures.
Maybe this will help.
Let go of my finger!
Do let go of my beer!
So help me, Bill, don't mess with my trigger finger!
No, now what are you gonna do?
Shoot me with my beer?
I don't think so.
Why are friends fighting?
He put his finger in my beer.
He dared me to.
You fight, but you both have the same goal.
So?
So.
Mr. Gribble, I want you to relax and imagine your fingers sliding right out of Mr. Doe Treve's beer.
That is the single most ridiculous thing I've ever... Uh... Chain Wasana-san could never have done that.
Ah, Chain's a good guy.
Take me out to the ball game.
Take me out to the dung.
Buy me some crackers and apple jacks.
Oh!
Oh, money.
Pardon me.
Oh, money.
No way.
No goddamn way.
Dad, I was this close to enlightenment.
You can call putting paint on your head, anything you want, but we're Christians and we don't do that kind of stuff.
Why do you think we go to church every Sunday for fun?
Well, why do we go?
Because we're Methodist.
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you.
What is Methodism anyway?
Methodism is a rejection of Calvinism.
Ah, oh yeah.
So Bobby, you heard her.
You can't be a llama.
Oh, you're the boy.
Congratulations.
Now, hold on.
Wait, we're supposed to be on the same team here.
Of course we are.
Babby, do you love Jesus?
With all my heart.
Buddhist liar.
Mr. Hill, I would prefer that Bobby were simply a devout Methodist, but if he can use this experience to connect to his spirituality sincerely then... Yeah, yeah, okay.
We're running late.
Reverend, I'll see you Sunday.
We could always use an extra heart at the homeless prayer service on Saturday morning.
I'll mention it to the Mrs. Listen to the wind.
Let the wind take the world away.
What do you hear inside, Connie?
I just hear my dad's ignorance in my mom's empty-headed materialism.
No, wait.
Wait.
I hear my dad's empty-headed materialism too.
That's the loudest.
You expect too much of them, Connie.
Sometimes you have to let things be as they are.
So your parents don't like me.
Eh.
I'm carrying a few extra pounds.
Eh.
Easy for you to say.
You're a llama.
Sh, sh, sh, sh.
I'm teaching here.
Listen with your heart.
The beating of it will drown out everything else.
All that's left will be the sound of us.
Kiss me, Sanglog.
My child is an honor student at Westview Elementary.
Yeah?
Well, my child is God to billions of Asians!
Hey Connie, I noticed that you couldn't stop looking over at me.
I kept hearing flats.
I assumed they were coming from you.
Now come on, you two.
If one of you plays flats and the other plays sharps, we will have perfect harmony.
That doesn't even make sense, nitwit.
Shut up.
You're just jealous because you weren't chosen as llama.
I'm glad I'm not a llama.
The chain train stops for the ladies.
What is that supposed to mean?
Lamas can't have wives.
They can't even have girlfriends.
Is that true, Bubby?
It can't be.
I mean, how do they get new llamas if the llamas can't?
Oh, no.
Reincarnation.
I got it!
I'm leaving the Buddhahood.
Bobby, I won't let you.
I want to be with you too, but it's not our choice.
If you're Sanglug, you're Sanglug.
It's meant to be.
I can always tank the test.
I'll pick a bell.
Who owns a bell?
What if it is the bell?
I'll pick another cane.
They wouldn't make it the same thing twice.
Bobby, don't make this a game.
If you don't take that test tomorrow, I'm going to be wondering for the rest of my life if you're a llama.
And if you are, I'll be disrespecting Buddha every day.
I can't live with that.
So, how long you been celibate?
Three years.
The fourth year is a tough one.
You, you go tell my boy he's not a llama, now.
I can't tell him that because it's not up to me.
There's a Buddha saying, as the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart, the wind cannot overturn a mountain.
You're talking like a song from the Lion King.
Stop that.
It makes no sense.
Or does it make perfect sense?
What the... See, that's the type of... I'm gonna kick your ass.
If my ass is going to be kicked, then it will be kicked.
To the celibacy of monks.
The celibacy of monks.
Oh, they're there, Con Junior.
We know how you must feel, but really, you just dodge a chubby white bullet.
Oh, money, pardon me, hmm.
Oh, money.
Ugh, I don't know what the heck I'm doing.
Lama-Song-Lug, I miss Connie so much.
Wait, I'm Lama-Song-Lug.
What should we do?
Give us a sign.
I am the great Lamasanglug.
And you are not.
Forget about that dang Buddhist Huey.
I commend you.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I was just walking by and I thought I heard.
Don't take the test tomorrow.
I have to.
What have they got on you, boy?
I'm in a jam here.
Connie says she'll have to dump me if I don't take the test.
Well, we definitely can't have that.
That's why I'm preying my guts out.
But I'm not getting an answer.
I don't know what to do.
Uh, everything is gonna, it's gonna be alright.
So, just hang in there.
Okay then.
Don't forget to brush.
Okay, here we go.
Lord Hankill here, Methodist.
Sorry about missing the homeless prayer service.
Now, about Bobby, I'm pretty sure we're on the same page about this llama thing.
I was kind of hoping that you could just have him fail this test tomorrow.
You know, like you've had him fail so many other tests in the past.
Oh, and the starving kids.
I've got to go.
Amen.
Hey Bobby Hill!
Look!
I got a statue of Buddha!
Separated at birth or what?
If he picks right, he gets to keep all those prizes.
What if he picks wrong?
Caps, Snaffler.
Snaffle's cap's all fall-sized jugs, bottles, and jars, and it really, really works.
This is the final test.
Please, choose an item you see on this rug.
I can pick anything I see on this rug.
Yes.
I pick Connie, right there in the mirror.
I make him pick for real, he's cheating.
There is no cheating.
The test has been taken.
He has chosen.
Oh Bobby.
Do you think maybe I should pick?
No.
Pack it up.
But that was Senglak's mirror.
I know.
But he didn't pick it.
But he used it.
Tough call.
But it's mine and I made it.
Yeah, yeah, Buddhist, whatever, monks.
