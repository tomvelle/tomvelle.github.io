So, meeting a woman on the internet.
How do you like that?
Now, I'll take care of everything while you're away.
I even made a tape of all your plant's favorite songs.
Oh, Bill, Peggy and I were thinking Bobby could take care of Boom Howard's house while he's gone.
I see.
Bobby's a good kid, but, uh, you looked at his room lately?
So what do you say?
It'll be good for the boy.
Teach him some responsibility.
Hey man, whatever you know, he'd like a lot to do, man.
He'll want one of them bonsai and then we'll feed the koi.
Just think, Bill, this'll free up for new challenges.
Like what?
So if we could have the keys... Oops.
Here.
You know I'm not really here for a free haircut.
I'm here because I'd like to check up on what's happening.
What's going on?
What's now?
I gotta tell you baby doll, you're very now.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
The name is Rad Thibodeux.
Here's my card, you know.
So, you know I'm for real.
Badical concepts.
That sounds exciting.
Well, only if you think the fast-paced celebrity field life of a concert promoter is exciting.
And your name is Rad.
How clever.
You know, I've noticed that we've been talking a lot about Rad.
Not too much about Miss Sweet Lou Ann.
Me too.
Well, tell me something.
You got a lover?
You know, I don't even have a boyfriend.
My last one, Buckley, blew up in a propane explosion.
You know, I can tell you're a very sensitive young woman.
And sensitive people, they do have a hard time in our society today.
I mean, I should know.
As a self-proclaimed genius, I myself, Rad Thibodeux, am often misunderstood.
Self-proclaimed genius?
Yes.
You poor thing.
Oh, what do you think?
Damn, that's a fine job, baby.
That's such a fine job.
You know what I'm gonna do.
I wanna ask you out.
You don't know it yet, but you're gonna say yes.
He's right!
I'm trusting you with Boomhauer's keys, Bobby.
Now remember, it doesn't just unlock the front door.
It unlocks a new phase in your life as a responsible adult.
Why is Mr. Dothriev looking at us like that?
He's proud of you too, Bobby.
Yo man, that don't dang a leave mess, man.
I'm busy right now.
They just leave me the name, number, date.
And that don't dang a, no one's listening to nothing like that.
Boom hour, pick up.
Boom hour, pick up.
Pick up, boom hour.
Pick.
Oh, right, your way.
Hey, good looking.
Hey.
Bobby, this is my new friend, Rad.
That's what his license plate says.
Well, you see, in the industry, man is only as good as his word, so keep it.
You know, nobody's gonna know that you are a man who keeps his word.
You break it?
Oh, God.
Man, I'm telling you, the freebies, they drive like a puddle in the sun.
Whoa.
Brad, what do you mean by the industry?
The entertainment industry.
Whoa!
There you go.
Dad, I would like you to meet a new friend of mine in Luann's.
Hey there, partner named Rad Thibodeox.
Pleased to meet you.
Here you go, businessman, two businessman.
Isn't that pronounced Thibodeo?
Well, you know, sometimes you're about a mistake, but no damage done.
Now, Luann has told me about you, so I know you're gonna love these free CDs.
A-O-L?
Mm-hmm.
Guess what?
You sign up right now?
I get 10 free hours.
All you gotta do is tell them that's so rad at AOL.com sent you.
Hey mom, dad, got it going on?
I got what?
Doing what?
Bobby, what have you done to your sleeves?
Well, this is how Rad sleeves himself.
It's industry.
You know, I don't much care for that Rad fella.
Rad, the Bedeics, is a self-proclaimed genius.
I'm gonna make you a sandwich we live in.
What kind do you want?
I'd like a, um... I don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong, baby, no?
Nothing.
Oh, it's just, well... I didn't ever get to go anywhere this fancy with Buckley.
Except his funeral reception.
Oh, there there, sweetness.
It's different now.
Rad's here, baby.
Rad's here.
Say my name.
Rad.
Say, hey, Jay.
Got it going on?
Oops.
Careful, Bopay.
You could have wet Rad.
Oh, Rad's cool with that.
Aren't you, Rad?
Um, Rad, I was speaking to you.
Bobby.
Listen, I know you want my attention and that's nothing I can't handle, but at the moment, I am busy with the late day.
You can see Lou Ann anytime, but I have school and stuff to do.
I have to take care of Boomer's house while he's away.
Mm-hmm.
How long is, uh, he away for?
Pleased to see you!
Enjoy the music, y'all, and the free food.
I'll go put this on the bed.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You better not do that.
Now, Jeremy's in there.
He isn't busy, if you know what I mean.
Ha ha ha.
In the meantime, you know, I am feeling kind of thirsty.
My beverage is on the south end of the levee.
You know we're booming, I keep the spare stash.
I'll get his number from Bobby.
We can call him and ask him.
Listen to you.
Hey, does Boop Howard know about this party?
Uh, does he need to?
Yes.
Why?
This isn't fair.
I'm not a self-proclaimed genius, so I don't know who's had as good an answer as you do.
Wait.
Wait, I know why.
Because you should tell people if you're gonna throw a party in their house without asking them.
In the red, I fell in love with ought to know that.
But come on!
Make everyone leave!
Oh, no, Lou Anne.
You don't want to make me and Mr. Boomhousie look like bad hosts, do you?
That's it, Red, the Badaics!
I am not your girlfriend anymore!
Wait a minute.
I never proclaimed you to be my girlfriend, baby doll.
Welcome, buddy.
Enjoy the music and the free food.
I will not.
You get out of here.
You too.
And you too.
This is a smoke-free house.
The only thing hotter than this tub is you two ladies.
Uh-oh.
Dad, I'm in my underpants.
Yeah, that was your decision.
You gotta live with it.
Look at this place.
12 years old and drinking a beer?
I didn't even like it.
Well now you're just trying to get me mad.
Your father and I are replacing you as Boom Howard's house-sitter and we'll be keeping the $1 a day for ourselves.
That's right and I'm taking away your suitcase of props.
Fine.
I could do my comedy without props.
So, you ever notice how?
How?
You can't take away my props!
Because of you, I'm prop-less.
Hey, you can't throw those out.
This CD is all I've got left of red.
He didn't give it to you, Bobby.
He gave it to me.
You were never even part of his inner circle.
You were just a hanger on.
Take that back!
Like AJ.
State your purpose.
Mr. Gribble, I'm having a problem with Luann.
Do you know anything about getting even with people who have done something bad to you?
No, Bobby.
Nothing at all.
Bobby!
Test gardening.
I didn't do it.
Bobby, we just saw you spit dirt all over.
Why would I put dirt in my own fruit pie?
My own fruit pie.
Why you do a lot of things is a mystery to me.
See you later Aunt Peggy.
If I find out that this was you and not a laundry accident, I'm going to be really mad.
Huh?
How do you like that?
Peggy, Peggy, come in here.
Well, that's me.
A camera in the bedroom.
This is kind of fun.
This is Hank Hill with the news.
Hi.
You are terrible.
You're getting to be a handful, Bobby.
And nobody likes a handful.
Sweet tarts.
If this is wrong, I don't want to be right.
Couldn't help hearing the bubbles.
Mind if I join?
Oh, dear lord.
Get the hell out of here, Dale.
Is anything the matter, Luan?
My birth control pills have stopped working.
I should have known when they started tasting sweet.
Like candy?
This isn't funny, Bobby.
Oh, I disagree.
You don't understand.
Every woman has to take a birth control pill every day or else they get pregnant.
Just take two now.
Hurry!
That would destroy my insides.
That's how it works.
Take em!
There's only one way to teach Dale the meaning of no.
Mom!
Dad!
I've got Luan pregnant!
Luan, I thought you were smarter than this.
I did.
Can you imagine the consequences if you had taken one of those fake pills and gone out and had unprotected sex?
Bah-ha!
I only got the pill to clear up my complexion and regulate my... Bah-ha!
Bobby's the one who messed with my medicine.
You messed with his fruit pies.
After that, he had nothing to lose.
I'll go tell him the truth right away.
No, not so fast.
Bobby has to learn that what he did was completely unacceptable.
Now as far as he knows, you are still expecting.
You want me to lie?
Well, deceiving somebody is never good.
But in order to teach Bobby the meaning of responsibility... I'll do it!
So, how's it going there, Sport?
Not so good.
Pretty big screw up, huh?
I feel bad about it, Dad.
Well, heck, we all make mistakes.
The point is, you can make up for them.
Really?
By doing the right thing, of course, you're gonna have to marry Luann.
But I'm only 12 years old.
Well, just think you could be married for 80 years.
Dad, you can't make me marry Luann.
Yes, I can, Bobby.
You're only 12 years old.
Please dad, I don't want to marry Luann.
Well, it's a little late for that.
You didn't take care of boom-hours, you drank beer, you messed with Luann's lady pills.
I ask you, is that responsible behavior?
No.
Well, then having to marry Luann will be a good lesson for you.
Lan, I know we've had our differences, but I was kind of hoping we could make up and not get married.
Uncle Hank!
Bobby's trying to get out of marrying me!
Bobby, you cut that out!
Well, you barely touched that Sunday, Bobby.
I'm not really hungry.
Come on, what kind of bachelor party is this?
Better live it up while you can before the wife is after you to watch the waistline.
Yep, this is the last free night of your life.
To Mr. and Mrs. Bobby Hill, may their marriage be every bit as wonderful as mine is.
And as mine was.
Bobby, I've got to do my homework.
Homework?
You go on and do your homework.
Just let me watch you for a little while.
Oh, my little man, I brought this for you.
Mom, mom, I don't want to do this.
Well, of course you don't.
Come, my child.
Me!
Me!
It's finally happening!
Bobby Hibbilly is marrying Hibbilly Cousin!
Haha!
You owe me five dollars!
Haha!
In your face!
Bobby, do you take Luann to be your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?
That sounds like a yes to me.
All right.
Luann, do you take Bobby to be your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Oh, Bobby!
Oh, no.
I think I need to lie down.
Oh, can I tell him now?
Can I tell him how we fooled him?
Oh, Luan, I am really, really sorry about this, honey, but I have some bad news.
It turns out that Bill is actually a licensed minister.
You mean I'm really married to Bobby?
Legally?
Yes.
Then I'll just get a divorce.
That's what I'll do.
I'll say he hit me.
I guess you could do that, but the law is you have to wait a year.
That's to give you time to patch things up.
No!
Please, Luanne, I don't think I'm ready for this yet.
Look, we're going to have to deal with this being married thing so the sooner we make the rules the better.
I get to date as much as I want with whoever I want.
You could see Connie if you want to, but just not in public.
Nah, it changed my mind.
You can't see Connie ever.
Look at the happy newlyweds.
How come they get to be married when I never do?
Why do they get to be so happy?
It's not fair.
It's not fair.
It's a fake.
It's all a fake.
I'm not a minister.
They'll use the self-playing piano.
It's all a great... It's a great big fake is what it is.
That sure was some good parenting.
I don't think the experts would disagree.
Mr. Duck Chief says Bobby and I aren't really married!
I'm still keeping those placemats he gave us.
Placemats?
That's it?
Well, he's one of your best friends.
You want some milk with that?
I do.
I'm glad we're not married anymore.
But you know what?
I could do a whole lot worse.
I'm sorry for the pranks, Luanne.
And you probably shouldn't open your laundry hamper very quickly.
Unless you like snakes.
Thank you.
Oh, you might not want to ride downhill on your bike.
Something might be wrong with the brake cable.
Oh, don't use your mouthwash around an open flame, alright?
I'll try not to.
Oh, um, you might want to stop drinking that milk.
I don't think I'm ready for this yet.
