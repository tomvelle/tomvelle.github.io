1
00:00:02,444 --> 00:00:08,093
Hey, me and Dale are taking Bobby's troop up by the lake for order of the straight arrow this weekend.

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,436
Y'all want to come for old time's sake?

3
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:11,538
Well, of course I'll go.

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:14,863
I'll never miss an order of the straight arrow.

5
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:16,706
Not since ours.

6
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,430
Yeah, ours was something special.

7
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:21,754
Now for the final test.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,296
The snipe hunt.

9
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:24,598
Not gonna sugarcoat it.

10
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,523
Some of you ain't coming back.

11
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:32,064
Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era.

12
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:33,986
Those who don't, will be dead.

13
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:36,530
Question.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,110
Are you ready?

15
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,492
Yeah!

16
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:45,161
If you want the test of silence, useless, give me a silent stick.

17
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:51,430
For the rest of your long, miserable life, you will carry the scar of failure.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,072
Now go give me a beer.

19
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,240
And you boys get out there and bag some snipe!

20
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:03,769
Snipe!

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:04,771
Shut up, Dale.

22
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:05,913
There is no snipe.

23
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:07,496
I heard my dad talking to your dad.

24
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:08,959
So what are we doing out here?

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,384
We're going to get snackered, I tell you what, boy, man.

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,355
I want to get all messed up and just pollute our minds out of three sheets of dang old wind, man.

27
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:27,763
I grew up I'm gonna drink this stuff every day just like my dad and fly jets and maybe even be an astronaut.

28
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:31,550
I'm gonna live in London and be a rich millionaire and have people killed.

29
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:37,660
I'm gonna sell propane and propane accessories if my grades are good enough.

30
00:01:40,945 --> 00:01:42,788
Oh kids and their crazy dreams.

31
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,735
I'm so depressed I can't even blink.

32
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:22,701
Well, we're gonna make some men out of those twelve-year-old boys tomorrow, I tell you what.

33
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:25,224
Well, we still get to play practical jokes, right?

34
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:27,007
They're not jokes, Bill.

35
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:28,529
They're painful lessons.

36
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,713
I thank my father for all the tricks he played on me.

37
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,037
He taught me the most wonderful lesson a child can learn.

38
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,080
Never trust nobody.

39
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:41,646
That's how I know Bob Dole's faking that dead arm.

40
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,746
I tell you what you do, man, I don't even know how to handle a water trick that's gonna work every time, man.

41
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:52,514
You just put it in a water like that, and it don't, it's, they spend a whole dadgum day like that cleaning up that dang old pee-pee.

42
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,376
Yeah, but those are getting tired.

43
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,078
We need some new material.

44
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:59,522
Dad, can me and Bobby bring a life preservers?

45
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:03,246
If you want to be sissies... He said yes!

46
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:07,095
Hey, Dale, uh, there's your wife's, uh... Healer.

47
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,802
Yeah, John Redcorn, let's get some funny Indian stuff to do.

48
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:12,626
Hey, John Redcorn!

49
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:15,631
Hank, Dale, Bill, Whomhower.

50
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:22,645
John Redcorn, we've got this order of the straight arrow retreat tomorrow, and I was wondering... I'd be honored to look after your wife.

51
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:26,112
Oh!

52
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,445
Well, gee, thanks.

53
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:34,039
But what I was really wondering is if you had some good Indian stuff for the ceremony around the campfire.

54
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:39,291
Hmm, our rituals are considered sacred and are passed down only in the nation.

55
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,674
Oh well, that don't bother us.

56
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:43,020
Hell no, we'll take a sacred one.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,088
There is a very ancient ceremony I learned from my grandfather.

58
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,563
We call upon the sacred Wimatenya, and we ask him to breathe life into our spirit bag.

59
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:56,716
See, spirit bags, Wimatenya, funny looking headband.

60
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,203
Oh, the boys are going to eat this stuff up.

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,942
The spirit bag is very sacred.

62
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,484
You should not make light.

63
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:07,269
I like how you say everything's sacred.

64
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:08,250
That's funny too.

65
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:09,752
Let's do that, Hank.

66
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,056
I got a bunch of ladies tennis socks we can use for spirit bags.

67
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,058
I got them in a divorce.

68
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,741
Now, every time she plays, she gets blisters.

69
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,264
It's been six years, Bill.

70
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:23,368
Don't you think she'd have bought some new socks by now?

71
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,436
I want to get that straight arrow patch so bad.

72
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:30,565
I'm going to put it right here next to my sewing patch.

73
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,709
It's supposed to be hard.

74
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,560
I heard they make you walk on hot coals and then you have to eat them.

75
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:38,522
Ew!

76
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,446
After you walk on them?

77
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:44,932
Hell, that's hot!

78
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,655
Hell, you're not kidding!

79
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,496
Fuck!

80
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:48,217
Hardone, mate!

81
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,040
Did I just hear what I almost heard?

82
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,985
I was gonna say... Fuuuugget about it!

83
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,571
Son, Peggy Hill knows half a swear word when she hears one.

84
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:58,752
Can I go to sleep?

85
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:01,717
You had the coolest mom.

86
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,360
She smells like Miracle Whip.

87
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:06,644
Hey, guys.

88
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,106
Hey, Eustace.

89
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,047
Hey, Eustace.

90
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:11,631
Hey, Eustace.

91
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:13,237
All right, Randy.

92
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,041
Remember, the purpose of this weekend is to have fun.

93
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,987
Daddy loves you whether you get your straight arrow patch or not.

94
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:21,769
What a load.

95
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,135
Can you imagine how I'd have turned out if my dad had loved me no matter what?

96
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:27,778
Thanks for the bus fare, Aunt Peggy.

97
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:28,819
Don't be silly, honey.

98
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,722
It is very important that you be there for your mama.

99
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:31,984
This is her big day.

100
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:35,429
Well, actually, her big day is a sentencing.

101
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:36,711
This is just the arrangement.

102
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:37,992
Here's a fun saver.

103
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:39,154
Take lots of pictures.

104
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,138
There we go.

105
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:46,899
Have a good time.

106
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,080
Here's a fun saver.

107
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,181
Take lots of pictures.

108
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:53,605
Gosh, Pig, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were anxious to see us go.

109
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,428
Well, that is not true.

110
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,490
You and Bobby are my whole life.

111
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,811
Come on, kids!

112
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:00,332
Let's go!

113
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:01,913
Everybody in the car!

114
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:02,794
I'm the light now!

115
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:03,975
Hold on, boys.

116
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:12,263
Before we go, we have to ask the Great Spirit, uh, Wumatanya, to watch over us on this trip.

117
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:19,377
This trip is about the sacredness of Mother Earth and all she gives us.

118
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:23,141
So pee now, because once we're on the road, we ain't stopping.

119
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,546
I'll see you Sunday, pig.

120
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:27,246
Okay.

121
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:27,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:27,927
All right.

123
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,370
Bye-bye.

124
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,072
Oh, damn it.

125
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,095
Looks like we're delayed a couple hours.

126
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,339
I gotta charge up the battery.

127
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:57,457
Drop the clutch on!

128
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:58,318
We metanye!

129
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,660
Let's spot license plates.

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,922
I see Texas, we metanye!

131
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:03,924
We metanye, there's another Texas, we metanye!

132
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,427
We metanye, I see Texas, we metanye!

133
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:10,766
Wimitanyay, Texas, Wimitanyay.

134
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,591
What you guys just shut up?

135
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,374
You didn't say Wimitanyay!

136
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:17,859
Boom, Howard, pass them.

137
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,640
I got an idea.

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,281
Pass them up.

139
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,185
Wimitanyay, ask Mr. Gribble's butt, Wimitanyay.

140
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:31,423
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in,

141
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,860
I see Texas, we matane!

142
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,021
All right, that's it.

143
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,203
Everybody pile out right now.

144
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:43,329
Okay, the 24-hour oath of silence starts now.

145
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,631
Hear your silence sticks.

146
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,732
Those are slim jeans.

147
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:48,934
That's what the white man calls them.

148
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:53,739
When matanya calls them silent sticks to test your spirit of shutting up.

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,382
Each time you talk, I take a bite.

150
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:58,644
Talk five times and you're out.

151
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:01,647
24-hour silence starting now.

152
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:08,346
Right now?

153
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,708
Bobby, son, you just talked.

154
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,351
Now, I'll let that pass, but don't talk again.

155
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,753
Thanks, Dad.

156
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,216
Son, give me that slim, Jim.

157
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:34,351
I'm hungry.

158
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,312
No problem.

159
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:41,425
Ha!

160
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:42,808
That was a test.

161
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,453
Joseph, give Mr. Dothrieve a bite of your silent stick.

162
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,738
Remember kids, you never know when you're going to be tested.

163
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,582
Now who else is hungry?

164
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:53,564
I am!

165
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:53,985
Gotcha!

166
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:58,171
Bobby, Randy, Garth, pass your silent sticks up.

167
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,076
See kids, it's harder than you think.

168
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:04,140
You don't want to end up like Randy's dad.

169
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,684
My dad's a successful patent lawyer.

170
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:09,248
Not in the eyes of Wumitanya.

171
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,231
I'm still hungry.

172
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,795
Who wants a dollar, say me?

173
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:15,176
Me!

174
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,043
Well, these things are addictive.

175
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:22,586
Lord Bobby, watch out, son.

176
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,950
You've lost more chores than anybody.

177
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,958
Now don't talk, no matter what.

178
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,741
But, Matanya, Mr. Gripple's not wearing his seat belt.

179
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:35,304
Bobby, you just got four in a row.

180
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,868
One more bite and you can't make straight arrow.

181
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,227
I'll take that jerky now.

182
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,674
Here it is, boys, the great outdoors.

183
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:59,551
Thanks to our efforts, we have preserved the nesting areas for the Texas spotted owl, the snail darter, and the endangered whooping crane.

184
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:03,636
And we eliminated 300 logging jobs.

185
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:11,591
Also, this note people, the brown herbal ecstasy is bad.

186
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,537
Do not, I repeat, do not take the brown herbal ecstasy.

187
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:16,538
Thank you all.

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,986
Oh man, what kind of lefty hootenanny is this?

189
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,313
Look at that one bouncing around in front of God and everybody.

190
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:28,678
Would it kill a tree if she wore a bra?

191
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm beginning to think this silence thing is just so we don't bother them.

192
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:54,024
They're not testing anything except for how dumb we are.

193
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:55,506
It's a whole trick.

194
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,048
My dad wouldn't trick us!

195
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:03,097
My dad wouldn't trick us.

196
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,925
We want to donate!

197
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,637
Wematanye, who wants another beer, Wematanye?

198
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,446
I am kicking elk.

199
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:26,832
As long as the sacred fire is burning, the oath of silence is suspended.

200
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:29,396
Take the log.

201
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,998
Shut up, I'm talking here.

202
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:47,722
We of the Order of the Straight Arrow, call upon the spirit Wematane, protector of the sacred ground, that brings us cool water to drink, and energy efficient, clean, burning, propane gas for all our sacred heating and cooking needs.

203
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:50,585
Wematane says, respect the earth.

204
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,589
She's ours by God, our tax is paid for.

205
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,753
Also, it says here, you gotta love all her creatures.

206
00:11:58,674 --> 00:11:59,755
Uh, let's see.

207
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:01,457
Oh, here we go.

208
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:10,469
Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you're going to recommend us to the spirit in the sky, with liberty and justice for all.

209
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,234
Womitanya is with you, and with Texas.

210
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:15,275
Amen.

211
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:20,822
Amen.

212
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:21,843
I'd like a room, please.

213
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:27,310
I am Senora Groscha, Ibanez, and I will be paying in cash.

214
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:31,747
Now we will say the oath of the order of the straight arrow.

215
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,752
A straight arrow tells the truth.

216
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,997
A straight arrow loves nature.

217
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:47,031
A straight arrow is against Bill H.R.B.D.7 to allow the importation of South American propane.

218
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:48,814
We must turn it.

219
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:52,740
And now for the final test, the snipe hunt.

220
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:57,701
You are about to come face to face with the deadliest beast in creation.

221
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:05,274
Those who survive will be honored members of the Order of the Straight Era, and those who don't will be dead.

222
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:09,842
Oh, Wematanie, protect us on our hunt.

223
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:15,972
All right, this here's your whoop-ass stick to beat the snipe back in case he comes at you.

224
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,715
Well, what does a snipe look like?

225
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:25,112
It's got red glowing eyes, long crooked teeth, a claw and a tail with another claw in the end.

226
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:27,175
Easy, Dale.

227
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,239
Bill and I'll take the lead.

228
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,202
Boom, Hauer and Dale will bring up the rear.

229
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:33,946
Remember, the snap call is this.

230
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:37,152
Woo-loo-loo, woo-loo-loo.

231
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:39,656
Well, call him out, boys.

232
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,138
He's not just gonna show up.

233
00:13:44,594 --> 00:14:08,188
got here look out Billy almost got you they'll be out there another hour then we'll go get them boy this takes me back what are you talking about

234
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:14,628
Oh my lord, that's a whooping crane.

235
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,021
There's only five of those left in the world.

236
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:19,868
Well, four now.

237
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,920
Then we should be thankful we got the opportunity to see one.

238
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,344
Now you done it.

239
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:32,067
Now you really gone and done it.

240
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,189
What do you mean, you?

241
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,611
We're all in this together.

242
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:35,692
Whoa, no.

243
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:40,398
Me and Boomhauer came on our own trip in our own conveyance.

244
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:43,803
You and I may be acquainted, but we are not traveling companions.

245
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:48,068
I'm merely here to enjoy Earth Day and play some hacky sack.

246
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:51,473
Dale, I'm gonna need you to give me the keys now.

247
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,131
I can't believe it.

248
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,033
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

249
00:14:58,534 --> 00:14:59,635
You thought it was a snipe.

250
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:00,836
We all did.

251
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,017
It was.

252
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:09,184
But when Matanya turned it into a whooping crane, so I could live to get my straight arrow badge.

253
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,287
Bobby, don't you get it?

254
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,749
Your dad made all that up.

255
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,552
There's no such thing as a snipe.

256
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:17,213
No!

257
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,655
My dad is the arrow leader.

258
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,438
He speaks only with honor.

259
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:25,482
We'll ditch the carcass by the interstate in the morning.

260
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,305
Now let's just go to sleep.

261
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,994
Yes, yes, we'll all just go to sleep now.

262
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,339
Bill, get his pants and shoes.

263
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,481
Uncle Doug.

264
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:39,909
Sir!

265
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:41,372
Huh?

266
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:42,805
Uh-huh.

267
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:43,086
Uh-huh.

268
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,048
Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you.

269
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:48,952
I'm with the Forestry Service and we're looking for a missing whooping crane.

270
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:50,534
Uh-huh.

271
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:50,694
Uh-huh.

272
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:56,261
And well, you see the birds tagged with the little transmitter and uptracked it to within ten yards of your campsite.

273
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,762
You haven't seen it, have you?

274
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:02,948
Uh, whooping crane in these parts, I think I would have noticed something like that.

275
00:16:03,008 --> 00:16:05,431
They're pretty rare, aren't they?

276
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,254
Oh yes, very rare and beautiful.

277
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,316
Sir, do you know anything about this?

278
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:15,422
Yeah, man, I tell you what, didn't even want him to snipe us last night, man, with him sticking and bagging and quack-quack, man.

279
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:18,925
If he'd go woo-loo, talking about that big mistake, y'all.

280
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:19,987
Just right there in that cooler.

281
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,932
Well, if you do see anything, you can contact the ranger station.

282
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,493
How about you boys?

283
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:30,758
Well, yeah, we... Uh, they can't talk for 24 hours.

284
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,780
Order of the straight arrow, you know?

285
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,441
Gotcha.

286
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,423
I was in the order myself.

287
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:41,430
Ah, the straight arrow hasn't changed a bit since I was a boy.

288
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:43,866
We gotta get rid of this bird.

289
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:45,228
What the?

290
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:47,071
We metanya!

291
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,293
We metanya!

292
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,595
We metanya!

293
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,276
Bobby!

294
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:50,777
Cripes!

295
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:52,018
Put that thing down!

296
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,561
Stop fooling around.

297
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,444
We've got to bury that thing fast.

298
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:57,327
We can't just bury it, Dad.

299
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:57,847
Remember?

300
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,793
We metanya wants us to honor the bird's sacred spirit.

301
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,018
And we will do just that in the dumpster behind Stuckeys.

302
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,143
Now let's get out of here before someone sees us, okay?

303
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,436
Murderers!

304
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:13,599
I have got to tell the ranger.

305
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:23,913
Brock!

306
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:24,995
Grasha.

307
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,398
I almost could not get away.

308
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,202
Amigo, it is time for some news operas.

309
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,325
Or shoes as you say in your country.

310
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:35,699
Senora, I have an Italian mock alligator.

311
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,221
You are going to love.

312
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:40,144
A size 16 for Senora Ibanez.

313
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:41,205
Cripple-E.

314
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,227
Brock, you are a genius.

315
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:46,210
Now, this is why I come to Lubbock's very big shoes.

316
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:49,534
I'll have Chuck and Buzz carry the box out to the car for you.

317
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:51,896
I saw him waving it over his head, really proud.

318
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:52,877
Uh-huh.

319
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:55,500
I also heard that they were hunting snipe last night.

320
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,962
There is no snipe.

321
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,063
My God.

322
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:01,907
How many more species have to be wiped out before we learn?

323
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:02,473
Easy.

324
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:03,194
Easy.

325
00:18:03,354 --> 00:18:04,196
Don't draw attention.

326
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,117
We're almost there.

327
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,059
We're going to make it.

328
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,263
What's that flapping sound?

329
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,668
Taste the wind one last time, bird spirit.

330
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:12,189
Bobby!

331
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,802
There they are, the nature haters.

332
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:20,824
Let's get them!

333
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,250
Pull over right here by that culvert.

334
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,241
Well, we can't stuff this bird in here.

335
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,082
It'll never fit.

336
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:45,464
You could eat it.

337
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:46,386
Damn.

338
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:49,150
And I filled up on silent sticks.

339
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:55,258
Brother Bird, I have given you a last flight and made my peace with you.

340
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:57,822
I release your spirit to win Mitanya.

341
00:18:58,563 --> 00:18:59,905
Woo-loo-loo!

342
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:01,948
Woo-loo-loo!

343
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,257
Son, would you please knock it off?

344
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,599
You're driving me nuts.

345
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,201
There is no wema, Tanya.

346
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:11,486
It's just some damn nonsense we made up to fill out the weekend.

347
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:12,347
Tell him, Dale.

348
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,990
How do you know my name, Crane Killer?

349
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,333
I never met any of you people before in my life.

350
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:19,995
Tell him, Bill.

351
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:21,397
He's right by me.

352
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,398
It's all a crock.

353
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:27,804
Those spirit bags of yours just makes wife's old socks, and by the way, I want them back.

354
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:31,969
So, everything you said was all a lie?

355
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,503
Yes, that's the secret of the Snipe Hunt.

356
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:35,664
That's the whole point.

357
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:41,952
Oh, I get it.

358
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,132
I guess.

359
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:44,115
Bobby, I didn't mean to let you down.

360
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:54,948
I just... When Dale and Bill and Boomhauer and me went through this as kids, all the tricks and lies from our dads, they were part of the experience.

361
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:58,092
It brought us all together, you know, us against them.

362
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,132
I don't want to be against you.

363
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:01,395
You're my dad.

364
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,841
We're supposed to be on the same team.

365
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:06,248
Of course we're on the same team.

366
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:07,451
You and me.

367
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:14,629
And now Team Hill is going to bury that whooping crane together and get out of this park without getting caught.

368
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:26,259
Sir, you lied to me, you lied to this little boy, and I don't know what you did to this gentleman in his underwear.

369
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,563
I'm going to have to take you into the ranger station.

370
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:32,186
Son, hand me the bird body.

371
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:40,996
I need it for evidence.

372
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,818
It's a miracle.

373
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,179
Well, I'll be damned.

374
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,422
We metanya.

375
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:50,941
I guess knocking a crane unconscious isn't a crime.

376
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,884
Although it's probably not good for them.

377
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,586
You're free to go.

378
00:20:54,606 --> 00:21:06,123
I knew you wouldn't lie to me, Dad.

379
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,606
That was just the final test.

380
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,430
When Matanya does exist.

381
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,192
The bird was just unconscious, Bobby.

382
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:19,061
No, it was dead until I made Wilma Tanya bring it back to life.

383
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:21,546
I'm a shaman.

384
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,229
Oh, God, my head hurts.

385
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,133
I can heal you, Dad.

386
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:27,217
Woo-loo-loo!

387
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:30,904
Woo-loo-loo!

388
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:52,574
Well, welcome home boys.

389
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:53,256
Did you have fun?

390
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't ask.

391
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,184
How was your weekend?

392
00:21:58,086 --> 00:21:59,388
Oh, same old, same old.

393
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,392
Did you do some shopping?

394
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,018
Yeah, I bought a microwave.

395
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:09,990
Boy, I tell you what, this family goes through microwaves quicker than most people go through shoes.

396
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:12,315
Yeah.
