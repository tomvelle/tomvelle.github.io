Um, I'm getting a lot of interference on the bedroom TV.
What do you say you unplug your peggies, put down the classifiers, and come on to bed?
Uh-uh.
As a former restaurant manager, I am accustomed to setting my own hours.
And unfortunately, these are the hours I have spent.
I know you miss running that restaurant.
Oh, it's not the restaurant I miss.
It's the people, Hank.
Managing people.
Telling them what to do and then watching as they do it.
Well, maybe you could ask the school to let your substitute teach the first grade again.
Those kids usually do what you tell them.
It's just not enough anymore.
I am a natural born leader who can build business from zero to infinity.
Must be highly motivated self-starter with own car.
My god, Hank, that's me.
Peggy, it's almost midnight.
You're gonna wake him up.
Oh, no.
I am gonna shake him up.
Who is it?
It is Peggy Hill.
Oop.
Well, that's the whole pitch right there.
Any questions?
Yes.
Metalife.
What is that?
Products for living.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, those are useful.
And you sell them?
Yes.
And I have a number of people who sell for me.
Oh, so you would consider what you do, sales or management?
A little bit of management, mostly sales.
Yes, management.
Thank you.
Lainey, I hope you don't mind me asking, but that pen, it is spectacular.
Oh, thank you.
So were my February sales figures.
I hit $10,000, which got me in the Metalive Double Diamond Club.
Peggy, if you want to be your own boss, come and work for me.
Hey, smell guy.
I'll take it.
Sign here, please.
You got a package, Peggy.
I signed for it.
But I was home, Bill.
I know.
I didn't want you to be bothered.
So what are you doing?
Put the package down.
You want to go for a walk?
Go back to your house.
OK.
Let's see.
These are the metal life shakes.
And here are the vitamins.
And these are 40, 40, 20 metabars.
That is, oh, presents.
So, uh, you're gonna sell these, are you?
Well, these things sell themselves.
Eighteen dollars, Bobby.
Which will make it very easy for the team of salespeople working beneath me.
Well, it sounds to me like one of those pyramid schemes.
No, not at all.
As the brochure describes it, it is not a pyramid.
It is a triangle.
And it is not a scheme, Hank.
It is an opportunity.
Good question, though.
This doesn't taste like raspberry truffle at all.
Well then, honey, you're eating it wrong.
Put it down.
All right, come on.
Let's get to it.
Hank, you will sell at work.
You're assistant manager.
I would think they would have to buy from you.
And Luanne, you will sell at college.
You must have made a whole bunch of new friends that you can pressure.
Well, it's probably about time I apologized for my misguided Y2K hysteria.
Who would have guessed the whole thing would go off without a hitch.
Really brought the country together.
Yep, best thing that ever could have happened with Y2K.
Hey Dale, energy bar?
I'm going the other way, thanks.
Boomhauer, how are you?
Protein shake?
No way, man.
I didn't talk about all I need of them.
They ain't gonna chop beef into blenders and eggs, man.
I'm talking about them body-by-boomhauer.
Uh, Dale, protein shake?
Uh, my tummy was minding a little something.
Let me take a peek at your wares.
What's that?
Those are vitamins.
What's that?
Protein shake.
What's that?
That's also a protein shake.
Oh.
What can I get for a quarter?
A soda 20 years ago.
Oh, great.
What do you want?
Hello, neighbor.
How are you today?
Hey, those that metavitamins?
You in that racket?
Okay.
I buy from you.
You will?
Yeah!
You wait here.
I'll get my wallet.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, my people, I call to order the very first meeting of my international sales force.
So, before we start, any fun sales stories?
Anything at all?
Okay.
Well, it's been a week, and at this time, I would like to please see your order sheets.
Ah, here you go, Peggy.
One sale.
I can't sell at the office.
It's a propane place.
I need to keep that pure.
Luanne, I did not get your sheet.
I didn't do one.
Oh, but I did give away all my samples.
What samples?
Those weren't samples.
My God, what am I running?
You think one sale between the three of us is going to keep this company going?
I am going to have to let one of you go.
Luanne, I'm sorry.
Uh, Peggy, Luanne's young.
She's got a great future ahead of her.
Fire me!
Send her a message.
I will fire you if your sales figures don't improve.
Now, put on your button, go to the airport, and move some product.
What?
You got another package I signed for it.
Mm-hmm.
Where is it?
Well, like I said, I signed for it, and I was carrying it up your path, then I got to thinking... You ate my bars?
No, I sold them on the base.
All of them, even the raspberry truffles.
I'm sorry.
Bill, I'm gonna use you.
It's okay.
Peggy, may I say what an honor it is?
Have you heard of a quota system?
Now, I give you a certain number of sales that you have to make by the end of the month.
So, we'll say this first month's quota is, oh, I don't know, $10,000.
What?
No, no, that's a lot of sales, Peggy.
Well, I thought as much.
I'll do it.
I can do it.
Then this conversation is over.
Sergeant, where's that Tata issue of sports illustrated?
I don't know, sir, but if I were you, I wouldn't be worried about a magazine.
No, I'd worry about, uh, no, nothing.
What?
General, the following statement has not been evaluated by the FDA, but the metalized protein bar can regrow hair.
Yeah, that's a bar.
It's your protein, Jake.
There you go, sir.
Yeah, that's right.
Yes, chocolate, I think.
$10,000 in his first month.
That William Dothrieve is quite a find.
Well, thank you.
I molded him, motivated him.
You know how it is.
Is he excited about the San Antonio conference?
Are you kidding?
Am I excited?
I cannot wait to go.
Oh, it's just for the salesman himself, Peggy.
Just the double diamond sellers.
And a guest.
Your own numbers were quite small.
Well, Lainey, my sales are low because of my management responsibilities.
You know, meeting with my supplier... I am your supplier, and meeting with me is like 10 minutes.
But it is a 15-minute drive, and I was 20 minutes late.
Peggy, if I knew you were coming, I would have put on pants.
Can you give me a minute?
Well, it's okay.
I have something important to tell you.
Now, because you met your quota, you have won a trip to the MetaLife State Sales Conference in San Antonio.
Did I mention that you get to bring a guest?
Ann, business etiquette dictates that you invite me.
In my wildest dreams, I never thought you'd want to go with me.
Of course, I will take you.
Yes, I'll even drive.
I guess it doesn't make much sense to take separate cars.
San Antonio, huh?
Well, when you get there safely, call me collect with the name Antonio, and I won't accept the charges.
Oh, and if you're not safe, then you'd use your own name.
Oh, Hank, my very first business trip.
I am finally getting the recognition that I have always given myself.
Isn't this Bill's trip?
Didn't he win it?
Aren't you just his guest?
Hank, you're fired.
Okay, you'll be in 2111.
And where am I?
2111.
The same room?
No, I will have you know, young lady.
You are talking to the sort of woman who would never, ever share a room with the sort of man who is talking to you now.
Look, this is San Antonio.
You can't just waltz in here and expect there to be rooms.
Wait, wait a second.
Rio Grand Suite, Sam Houston Suite.
Bill, these are all suites.
Don't look.
Do not look.
That is Marty Van Holt, Regional Sales Coordinator for MetaLife.
Oh my god, we are right across the hall from freaking Marty!
Look at this!
To our Double Diamond Sales staff, congratulations, Mike Desmond, CEO, MetaLife International.
Oh my god.
San Antonio, Bill.
She is all ours.
Well, you know, I think I'll just grab a newspaper, find a chair by the pool to sleep in.
Oh, nonsense, Bill.
You will stay here and sleep on the couch.
Well, I think I will have some of that champagne then.
Although technically it's just sparkling wine, unless it comes from the champagne region of France.
So, uh, Lou Ann, you still going to community college?
Of course, I'm still in the propane business.
That's where I was today.
Bobby?
Yeah?
What?
You said Bobby.
Oh, yep.
Can I watch TV while I eat?
Now, you know your mother forbids television during dinner.
It's family conversation time.
Ah, who are we kidding?
Hey Dean, congratulations on your numbers.
Looks like someone's going to Nationals.
What are the Nationals?
It's how they reward the top performers.
Your manager's manager.
And where are the Nationals held?
Right here.
San Antonio?
This room, and they fold back that wall.
No.
Yes.
Now that Peggy Hill needs to see.
Excuse me.
Phil, we are going to Nationals, and here's how.
Now, I'm going to employ a pie chart.
You tell me if I lose you.
Okay, right now, you account for 100% of sales, okay?
Now, what I need from you is more sales.
Do you think that you could sell 100% more?
If that's my new quota, that's my new quota.
Nationals!
Let's go out and celebrate tonight.
Someplace fancy, where they'll lend you a jacket, huh?
I won't even have to worry about stains.
Lainey.
Huh?
Honey, put me down for another 1,000 bars.
I am going to Nationals.
1,000 bars?
You know, you have to sell them to get to Nationals.
Or buy them yourself.
We really don't care.
Well then, go ahead and put me down for 2,000 of those bad boys.
Oh!
Oh!
Marty, Marty, put me down for another 2,000 bars.
I'm going to Nationals.
Mike, another 2,000 bars.
Bobby, when's this movie over?
I want to watch the news.
The news?
He watched the news yesterday.
Come on now, people.
If you don't like the show, there are other TVs.
Oh, Bill, will you look at it?
Hmm.
None have walked on that moon.
I guess sometimes the impossible is possible.
Yep, just like some would say it's impossible to move 2,000 units, but I know you could do it.
Yeah, I already sold half.
No.
Yeah, I talked the hotel into stocking all the minibars with them.
You did not.
Oh my god, we're going to nationals.
Come here.
All right.
This is the double diamond pin that you won.
I think you deserve it even more than I do.
No, I don't.
Why would you say that?
Because Bill, you are a kind, hard-working, superhuman people person who's taking us to nationals.
Oh, Bill Dothrieb, I love you.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Leave me alone.
Keep the jacket, keep the pen, keep the moon.
I quit.
The room keys in the jacket.
Lainey!
Lainey!
Cancel the order.
What?
I can't cancel.
I said cancel the order, my star salesman.
Just quit on me.
Well, so?
You can't return product.
That's just not how the system works.
Oh, come on.
I think the triangle can handle it.
It's not a triangle.
It's a damn pyramid.
Now you do whatever it takes to get Dothry back in the fold, or Marty Van Hold is going to come down on us like the Hanner of the Gods.
Hi, Bill.
I brought your mail.
Oh, look.
A postcard from Piggy Hill.
Having a great time in San Antonio.
Glad you're here.
Yeah, just put my waist corner on your way out.
Uh-oh.
Somebody lost weight.
Probably from all that hustling you were doing.
Yes, I'm a very attractive man.
I get it.
Now go.
Hold on, Bill.
Do you like beer?
Then those big feediers do 180?
Bill?
This has been nice.
See you at the sales meeting tomorrow?
That sounds exciting, but Tuesday's my ass scratching day!
Everything was going great, but then when I try to motivate him, that's the management term, with a little praise.
My term, he goes plumb loco, Spanish term.
You must have confused him.
Being dumped on is all Bill knows.
First there was that childhood of his, then he joined the army and then married that backbreaker, Lenore.
Well, I'm going to go oil the bearings in your suitcase wheels.
San Antonio dust contains a lot of silica.
Your father's right.
Bill has had a hard life and he likes it that way.
He likes to be treated badly.
It's called psychology, Peggy.
The disease of psychology.
I'm taking it past fail.
Well, of course.
He's crazy.
Well, if insulting him is the only way to get Bill back to work selling, it is that nut job's lucky day.
Okay, let's see.
I certainly can't attack his sales ability.
Um... Come on, there's plenty to work with.
It's Bill Dothrieve.
He's bald, but he still has dandruff.
I mean, what's that all about?
And don't forget his outer!
He's afraid of thunder!
Okay, good, but slow down, slow down.
Hey Baldi, if you're looking for the hair on your head, why don't you check your shoulders and your back?
Get off my lawn.
I don't fertilize with poo.
Oh yeah?
Well, I wouldn't waste all that water on your lawn.
You're gonna need it to hose yourself down later because...
You stink.
You heard me.
Even in France they would take notice of your bad odor.
Well, you were rude.
But in the morning, I'll be sober.
Shut up.
Lonely divorcee, or you will be alone for the rest of your life.
yeah well uh oh never mind you couldn't have gotten me to nationals anyway lazy good for nothing quitter whoa won't just hold wait hold on just give me one more chance please i'll sell all your bars i know i can one chance tomorrow morning my garage seven wait it's a little early you just bought yourself 645 mr well i guess i could get my shower seven it is
Don't you worry about you.
Soon as I load the last box of chromium biscuits into my car, I'll start pounding the pavement.
Hey, what are you doing?
I did not say you could take a break, did I?
Oh, it's my toe.
I think I have a blister.
Well, if you do, it's not from carrying boxes for one day.
It's from carrying that huge gut of yours around for 40 years.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Don't ow, worry about your driveway.
My tube sock is soaking up most of the blood.
Ow!
Bill.
Yeah.
Bill, you're fired.
Yeah, buddy.
Every now and then, I could do better.
I could sell all these.
We can go to nationals and that's what you want.
Not if it means taking advantage of a friend.
No, I, no, not you, my friend.
No, no.
Yes, Bill, I am your friend.
Although I haven't always been a good one.
Taking advantage of your low self-esteem to boost my own already healthy esteem.
And for that, I apologize.
No, Peggy, you don't have to apologize to me.
I, I, I'm not.
Uh, uh, uh.
The next words out of your mouth better be Apology Accepted.
Apology accepted.
So, friend, between you and me, I think this metal-eye thing is a scam.
Yeah, but what a ride.
Of course I'm still in the propane business.
