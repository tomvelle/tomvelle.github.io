Oh!
Oh!
See the tall one with braces?
That's Amanda.
I'd give anything to be a flannel nightgown at that sleepover.
It'll never happen.
But I do have an unobstructed view of hot girl-on-girl pillow fight action from my bedroom window.
Not as good as the view from my roof with my dad's thermal goggles.
I'll be able to see their body heat.
Later, Bobby.
Lights out at 9.30.
After that, no laughing, no singing.
No flashlight, no ghost stories.
No, nothing except sleep.
Also, you have to sign this.
It says that we are not responsible for any injury that might occur during sleepover.
Susan Clemens, is it?
You forgot to initial here.
Okay.
Enjoy.
Sleep over.
Dang it.
Show's over.
What are you doing?
What part of the contract didn't you understand?
Give me the pillows.
That's it, Susan.
Hide the pillow.
Good girl.
Oh!
Cuff it up.
You're not gonna sleep now, are you?
I'd leave now, but I already paid your dad for the continental breakfast.
Yeah.
Bobby!
Honest Connie, I wasn't watching!
Bobby, my party's dying.
Can you come over?
Yes!
Woo, Bobby!
Take it off!
Give the girls what they paid for.
Oh, my God!
Shake it, baby.
Oh, give me some motion.
Oh, yeah.
She's got nice ones.
What are you doing?
This is a sleepover, not a play music loud all night over.
What's Chane Wasana Song doing here?
I might have told him you were having a sleepover.
What's up, ladies?
Beat it, Wasana Song!
Check it out.
It's Booby Hill.
When God was passing out wit, you thought he said zit, and you asked for seconds.
Now, out the window!
We're not going anywhere.
We came for a pillow fight.
Connie's dad took them all.
Then how about just...
Fight.
What was that?
No boys in slumber party.
Oh, hey, Chane.
How you doing?
How's your dad?
Still on membership committee at Nine River Country Club?
Yes, sir, Mr. Soup.
We were just walking by, and we saw Bobby sneaking in the window.
And I wanted to make sure Connie was OK.
Bobby here, out the window.
Chane, you and your friends may use the door.
Alright guys, the girls aren't here.
We don't have to pretend to be tough.
Come on, I live next door.
All I have to do is scream and my dad will be on you like flies on pie.
If you eat some dirt, then maybe I'll leave you alone.
But I don't want to eat any dirt.
Well, maybe just a little.
Yum, that's good dirt.
You didn't eat any.
Dad, dad, dad!
Maya, con Dios.
Help!
Bobby?
What have you been eating?
Jane was Sonny's song.
Made me eat dirt.
He beat me up.
I'll get some ice.
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll find out Jane's address so you can go over there and make his dad eat dirt.
Bobby, remember when you were 10 years old and I pulled that big girl off you at the park?
Well, that's not happening anymore.
There is only one person who can fight your battles for you.
And I know you don't want to hear this, but that person is you.
Look at me!
This can't fight!
Well, then take a boxing course at the YMCA.
You can learn anything at the Y. That's where I learned how to fight.
You know, that's also where I learned to swim.
So, taking those boxing lessons kept the bullies from picking on you?
Bullies?
Picking on me?
Well, yeah, sure, why not?
I'm sorry, boxing is bull.
But I can't put you on the wait list.
People are always getting hurt.
You've got to help me defend myself from chain wasonisone.
There is one other class, but it wouldn't be right for you.
There's nothing about the YMCA that's right for me.
But until I'm famous enough to afford my own bodyguard, I am going to have to learn how to defend myself.
Now do your job, sir!
Every one of you in this class is heavily armed right now.
That's right, your key chain, your fists, that huge engagement ring.
Are you sure you're in the right class?
This is women's self-defense.
Please miss, all the other courses are full.
I'm sorry, it's for women only.
We're trying to maintain a certain comfort level here.
But I hate men as much as you.
I don't hate men.
I just hate being a victim.
I hate being a victim too.
Look, I was at a girl's slumber party last night when three men pushed me to the ground and made me eat dirt.
Okay, you can stay.
Now grab a whistle and prepare to be empowered!
Most women who were attacked are subdued by verbal threats.
Today we're going to get used to hearing these threats, keeping our cool and practicing some responses of our own to the most vulnerable areas of a man's anatomy.
Shut up and give me your purse!
I don't know you, that's my purse!
Okay, I want everybody to try it.
You first.
See, I don't hate men.
Give me your purse, now!
That's my purse.
Don't be afraid to shout it.
That's my purse!
Try it again.
That's my purse!
I don't know you!
What did you get for number five on the test?
D. D?
Ugh, I thought you wrote B. Hey, booby.
Connie, when you kiss this loser, do you still taste dirt?
No, not anymore.
Jerk.
You asked her about the dirt, she answered.
I don't think we have any more business.
Don't smartmouth me, Hill.
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
Come on, eat some dirt.
Let go of my purse!
Huh?
I don't know you!
Who's next?
Mom, Dad, Chane was waiting for me after school.
Did you remember to tell him that inside every bully there's a coward?
It's okay, Peggy.
I don't see any blood.
No dirt.
You ran away, didn't you?
No, I stayed and fought, and I won.
This is so much cooler than getting beat up.
Well, all right, son.
You know, that Shane Wasana song must know all kinds of oriental martial arts, and you beat him with good ol' American YMCA know-how.
Yeah, we're all excited, but before you get too carried away, I should let you know that I got detention tomorrow.
Detention for beating up a bully?
Well, I'd say somebody's earned himself a trip to a PG-13 rated movie.
My dad says that whenever you're in a jail-type situation, the best way to survive is to take out the biggest guy there.
That way you establish who's boss right from the get-go.
Or you can hang yourself with your pants.
He says that's another way to go.
Which one of you guys is the tallest?
That's my purse!
I don't know you!
Uh-oh, it's the metal shop kids.
If they hassle us, just run.
They won't be able to catch us because they smoke.
Hey, Bobby, playing a kickball today?
Why?
You up for a game?
Just say hi.
Just say hi.
Why are they scared?
You didn't kick another person in the groin, did you?
Free people.
Hey, I didn't go looking for trouble.
Trouble came knocking and Bobby Hill's foot answered the door.
You know, Bobby, I kind of liked it better when you used to play dad or joked your way out of a tight spot.
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
Tony's a Marty is wide open right now.
Hey, Peters!
You giving my friend here a hard time?
Back off.
This is none of your business, Bobby.
Oh, I'm making it my business, Peters.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kick me in the nads?
Am I gonna do it?
Yes.
When am I gonna do it?
Don't know.
Could be tomorrow.
No!
One thing you'll find out about me, Clark, is that I'm not a very patient person.
I wish I'd called you folks here under pleasant circumstances, but I'm afraid your son's been caught fighting again on the school grounds.
Well, first of all, my son was just defending himself.
Second of all, I do consider these pleasant circumstances.
Emily, send Bobby in.
Bobby, you want to tell your parents how you won your fight?
Which one?
The one against Jane?
Sure.
Okay.
Well, there I was standing in front of Jane.
It didn't look good.
I mean, let's face it.
He's faster and stronger than me.
So if I was going to beat this guy, I had to act fast.
Smart thinking, son.
So, I faked to my left, but he got a hold of me and knocked me down.
Downed but not out, I yelled, let go of my purse at the top of my lungs.
Then, with all my might, I kicked him as hard as I could in his testicles.
What?
Tell your parents about the Clark Peters fight.
So there I was standing, right?
You just skipped the end of the fight.
You mean before or after I kicked him in the testicles?
Bobby, I...
Where in the heck did you learn to do that?
At the women's self-defense scores I signed up for at the Y. Women's self-defense?
What did I do?
It was your idea to send him to the Y in the first place, so I could point the finger at you.
But I won't.
But I could.
I'm afraid we're going to have to suspend Bobby from school for a couple of days.
Hank, can I talk to you alone?
I'm not as principled apparent, but, you know, man to man.
Sure.
You can't have your boy going around kicking people in their testicles.
I know that, Carl.
This Bobby is the belt line.
You never, ever hit below that.
Always above, never below.
Cassius Clay never hit below the belt.
But dad, if I'm in a fight with someone who wants me to literally eat dirt, you're telling me I shouldn't do the one thing that's gonna save me.
Boom!
You learned to move in a woman's self-defense class.
You are not a woman.
But it works.
Son, I'm gonna show you how to fight above the belt.
Here.
They're my old YMCA gloves.
Put them on.
Okay.
Now, Bobby, just to warn you, you're probably gonna have to take a couple of shots before you learn how to protect yourself properly.
Now get your gloves up like this.
Good.
Keep your hands up, Bobby, and move a little.
Don't just stand there like a pole.
Come on.
Come on.
No!
Hey!
Come on, you're not moving.
I am, too.
I'm backing away from you.
Come on, from side to side, son, like this, see?
Huh?
Come on, come on, here we go.
Okay, okay, now try to hit me with the punch as hard as you can, come on.
You leave your face open, you're gonna get popped, see?
See?
Pop, pop, see?
You left yourself open, Dad.
You have been kicked in the testicles.
I palpated the left testy and everything checks out.
There's going to be quite a bit of swelling for a few days.
Well, what about the other one?
Well, we can't find it right now.
Oh!
No need to panic, though.
I'm sure it's there.
It'll probably make an appearance when the swelling goes down.
Man, they don't lie still, man.
They don't try to move, man, because they don't... You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Don't move, man.
Dad, I thought maybe you'd like some ice cream.
I'm sorry about what happened.
But when you hit me in the nose... You mean the nose above your belt?
If I remember correctly, and your shot below my belt hasn't affected my memory, I was teaching you how to fight above the belt.
It was the way I learned how to defend myself.
By kicking me in, my fellas?
Dirty pool, Mr. Dirty Pool.
Now, let's discuss your punishment.
Punishment?
For what?
You told me to go to the wine learn to defend myself, and I did.
No television, no video games, and no ice cream until further notice.
That's not fair!
You can't do that!
I'll tell you what I can't do.
Sleep on my stomach.
But I can sure as heck punish you.
Bill, toss me a beer.
I have to take my anti-coagulant.
I live in constant fear the day Joseph finally can take down his old man.
If I were him, I'd do it while I was sleeping.
Best chance he's got.
Although I've recently learned how to sleep with my eyes open.
God am I tired.
I wish I had a son to kick me in the nuts.
Be careful what you wish for.
Yeah, well, I promise you Bobby's sorry he ever did that.
Right now he's out back pulling weeds.
No gloves, no weasel.
Ragweed from a lady.
Where have you been?
Word in the halls as you got suspended for kicking principal Moss in the crotch.
What?
No, that's crazy.
I kicked my dad in the crotch.
You kicked your father?
We all have those feelings, Bobby, but you never act on them.
I heard what you did to chain my son a song.
Unforgivable.
Then I heard what you did to your father.
Very funny, so I'm conflicted.
Well, my dad didn't think it was funny, so he's giving me a million chores to do.
What?
The old man punishing you?
You don't have to take that from him till he can get up from that chair.
You're the boss.
That better not be what I think it is.
And I think it's a Game Boy.
Is it a Game Boy?
Yeah, Dad.
It's a Game Boy.
That's a video game I told you.
No video games.
Give it to me.
Hold on.
I'm almost done.
Now.
In a minute.
If you don't bring that to me right now... In a minute.
In a minute.
Get back here!
God, the pain is unbearable.
All right, mister.
You've got one minute.
Dang it, Bobby.
It has been at least a minute.
You started a new game, didn't you?
Yes.
We had a deal.
Hank, what is going on?
I'm punishing Bobby.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Give me that goddamn video game.
Not now.
I'm dealing with a giant spider here.
Bobby Hill, you give your father that game and you do it right now.
That's okay.
I got it under control.
He's gonna give me the game.
Soon, soon I'm almost bored with it.
Why don't you go inside?
I'll find you later.
Come on.
Hand it over.
Mom, this is between Dad and me.
And I'll give them the Game Boy when I decide I'm ready to.
That is it.
I would not let a stranger let alone my own son think for one second that they can get away with showing any disrespect towards the man that I love.
You do that, and you have to deal with Piggy Hill.
What are you doing, Mom?
What are you doing?
Mom, Mom, don't.
Game over, Bobby.
Come on.
That's it.
Come on.
Show me what you've got.
Give me that keyboard.
Give me that.
Come to mama.
That's right.
And I have... Oh, yeah!
That's mine.
Give it back.
In a minute.
That's my purse!
That's right, Bobby.
I believe you will find that I have no testicles.
Where's your secret weapon now, huh?
She bluffing?
Finish her!
I'm sorry, Mom.
It was a reflex.
Mom, okay!
I said I was sorry!
All right, Peggy, let him go.
Dinner in ten.
Well, I guess next time you won't try to take on your old man.
What are you so proud about?
You had to get Mom to fight your battle for you.
That's worse than me kicking below the belt.
Yeah, it's not so fun when someone doesn't fight fair, is it?
Just remember, I can get her to do that anytime I want.
Peggy!
Is there a problem out there, Hank?
We'll be right in.
Now go wash up.
Okay, deep breath.
I don't know you!
