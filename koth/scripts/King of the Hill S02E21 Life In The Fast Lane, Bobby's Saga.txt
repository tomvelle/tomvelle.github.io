Hey, man, my dying old wife in labor, man.
Gonna go to the hospital and have Ned Lamar's partner, man.
Good evening, sir.
Do you know why I pulled you over?
Because you beat me.
I wanna rematch.
Not here, this is a school zone.
There's an amateur race at the Speedway this weekend.
Winter gets to drive the pace car when NASCAR comes to town.
Whoa, man, you talkin' about that NASCAR, man?
I've been tryin' over five years, man, to get on that dang old pace car, man.
You gonna get me on there down on there?
I see I'm talkin' your language now.
Here.
I'm gonna let that go.
Okay, Bill, give her some gas.
Man, fuel mixture is still too rich.
Yep.
Hey, boomer!
Look at me!
Maybe I could be a race car driver too.
Yeah, Bill, you'd be a regular Dale Earnhardt if you could make it all the way around the track without stopping for a ding-dong.
Or you can do like Jeff Gordon did and have a rich daddy.
I hate that, Jeff Gordon.
I bet I could be NASCAR's top money winner, too, if my daddy had bought me a quarter-midget car instead of...
You know, corrective shoes that all the girls laughed at.
Yeah, his father didn't do him any favors, I tell you what.
My dad didn't buy me a car when I turned 16.
He sold me one.
And it was a lemon.
Taught me the value of a dollar.
My dad never sold me anything.
Hey, Dad, could you please sign this check?
I already filled it out for you.
Pay to the order of the bike barn, $175.
What's for a new BMX bike?
You expect me to just sign this?
I think you have to or it doesn't work.
Bobby, these checks aren't magic tickets.
They represent real money that I, and to a lesser extent your mother, work real hard to earn.
You can ride it whenever you want.
My point is you don't just get money because you ask for it.
You want to end up like Jeff Gordon?
I like Jeff Gordon.
He's handsome.
Bobby, you joke around like that in public.
People are going to think you ain't right.
Hey guys, little help here.
Thank you very much.
But Jeff Gordon is handsome and he's a great champion.
He's the world's fastest Christian.
He's a bad influence on our son.
Bobby thinks the world is just gonna be handed to him.
He has no concept of the value of a dollar.
Watch.
Bobby, come here.
Son, how much do you think those shorts you're wearing cost?
I don't know.
They're pretty nice.
A hundred dollars?
A hundred dollars for a pair of cotton short pants.
What do you think the average salary is in this country?
Well, Jim Carrey makes twenty million a movie.
You see that?
He doesn't even know the difference between twenty million and twenty thousand.
You know, Bobby, they say old Buck Strickland started out with nothing but a single dollar bill.
And now he's at the top of the propane ladder.
Bobby, here's your dollar.
Let's see what you can turn it into.
What are you doing, son?
Did you use that dollar to start a shoe shine business?
What?
Bobby!
You almost made me drop it!
This is what you spent your dollar on?
No.
I also got a quesadilla.
It's from the value menu.
Well, thank you, Hank.
Your plan certainly backfired.
You spoiled his appetite.
Okay, I guess I was wrong.
But I'll get through to him.
There's a way in there.
I know there is.
Maybe it's time Bobby got a job.
Hank, it's his vacation.
He's just a boy.
He should be doing boyish things.
Bobby.
How would you like to go to cooking school?
I'm listening.
Bobby, I know we've never talked about this, but someday I'm going to die.
And when that happens, then you can go to cooking school.
Come on, Bobby.
You're coming with me to the race track.
Well, Bobby, what do you think?
The rope is soft and pretty.
Look at the pace car, Bobby.
It's what Boomhauer gets to drive if he wins his amateur race.
What's a pace car?
Well, it's the car that all the other drivers have to stay behind at the beginning of a race or whenever there's a crash.
If Boomhauer wins, he'll have the honor of driving on the same track as Dale Earnhardt.
Or, as you'd look at it with Jeff Gordon.
Jeff Gordon's a race car driver too?
I thought he was just a cereal box model.
Hey, Soda's here!
Get your sodas!
Hey, I'll take one.
Nice hustle, son.
I can rest when I'm dead, sir.
You hear that, Bobby?
That is a good attitude.
That's what Mr. Witcher told us.
He's my boss.
Maybe someday you can land a job like this.
Why not today?
Mr. Richard, I wonder if you have an opening for my son Bobby here.
Well, if you work for Jimmy, you're gonna work hard.
People up there are hot and dry.
They want someone cold and wet.
You do your job, you make money, but you work hard.
Because that's the way you work if you wanna work for Jimmy.
So, if I understand you correctly, you're saying you'll teach my boy the value of a dollar.
If you work for Jimmy, you're gonna work hard.
You make money.
The people are hot and dry.
That sounds just fine.
This is gonna be a great experience for you, son.
My dad told me if I worked hard, I could be another Buck Strickland.
Well, I don't know who the hell Buck Strickland is, but my dad told me I couldn't leave this job until I got someone to replace me.
Good luck, Bobby.
You're gonna need it.
Ooh, you look so good in that apron like a cooking school professor.
Say cheese.
Cheese.
Don't smile, son.
You're a working man.
All right.
Now, remember, Bobby, if there's a crash on the track, here's the fun saver.
Try to get me two angles.
Tease the tentacles.
Don't come unknock it, because these trucks are rocking.
Hey Soda!
Hey Soda here!
I got peanuts!
Peanut!
Hey!
Soda!
Oh, is that diet?
Reg... regular.
Sorry.
Hey you, you want a hot dog?
Sure.
Alright.
450 for a jumbo dog, and 20 for a tray of stolen drinks, and the 28 you owed me.
Now you owe me, oh yeah, you owe me 52-50, Tommy.
I'm not Tommy, I'm Bobby.
You making fun of me?
Your tray 27.
See?
27.
Tommy.
Go sell some sodas, Tommy.
You know, maybe now's a good time to run some pit crew drills.
Time us, boomhauer.
Bill, you clean the windows.
Ah.
Dell and me will take tire duty.
OK.
Go.
Fire one.
Check.
Fire one.
Check.
Fire two.
Tom out.
Man attached.
Man attached.
Mr. Witcher, I think I'm ready to go.
Okay, you owed me $68 in trays, and you paid me $72, but you also owed me $40 for a total of you owing me $88,888.88.
Hey, there's our working man.
Here, Bob.
Grab a root beer.
Yep.
You can say yep, too.
You've earned it.
Dad, I want to quit.
What?
Quit?
It's horrible, Dad.
It's hot, and the tray is heavy, and my boss is really mean, and he calls me Tommy, and he watches TV in a hot dog, and I think he might be a moron.
Now, Bobby, I know your first day was hard, but don't call your boss names.
That's acting like a baby.
Babies want everything handed to them.
But you're there to work and not play.
That's why it's called work and not play.
And if you don't understand that, well, son, maybe you're the moron.
There you go.
Now, what you need are a few pointers on salesmanship.
Remember, a good salesman always says yes to the boss.
He approaches every task with a can-do attitude.
And when things get tough, he shrugs it off and sings a happy tune.
This is that thing about me giving 110%, right?
Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you.
That's tray number three, Mr. Witcher.
I'm giving 110%.
You know, I have to admit, at first, I didn't think you were the best boss.
I'm the boss.
I know, I know.
My dad sent me straight, and I'm gonna be the best worker you ever had.
You work for me.
You bet I do.
You're gonna see a whole new Tommy today.
Ah.
How would you want to be my go-to guy?
That's me!
Okay.
First, you go to the men's room and mop out the unorals.
Then, you go to my cigarettes in my car.
Then, go to back here.
Can do!
Alright, give it another push.
Dale, no faking this time.
Dad!
Dad!
Your advice really worked!
Mr. Witcher promoted me to... go-to guy.
Wow, I hope you'll still return my calls.
You got any other success tips for me?
Well, here's a great one.
Find the job nobody wants and then do it better.
I'll do it better.
You're the go-to guy.
Welcome to the amateur classic one hundred
No!
This is exciting!
This is exciting!
I'm excited, Hank!
We'll get excited when Boomhauer takes that checkered flag.
Right now, we got a job to do.
Smash it down good Tommy!
Smash it!
Down!
Smash!
Yeah!
Good I said!
Don't be afraid of them bottles!
They pop good!
Make them pop good!
Smash!
Can we bring him in?
Can we bring him in?
His windows look pretty dirty.
Well, he's probably low on gas.
I'll set the flag.
Hey, remember to keep Dale away from the, uh, well, everything.
I'll get the gas, check the tires, and the suspension.
I'll get the windows!
Dale, here's a bucket of sand.
Hold it with both hands.
Uh, Hank, what am I supposed to do with a sand and slip and hang?
Never mind.
All set, boom-hour!
Go!
Go!
Go!
I think we did it, Bill.
We kept Dale from screwing it up.
Bill?
Don't give him that window.
Dang it.
Dang it.
Wait up, man.
You saying no?
Can't say no to the boss.
And I'm the boss.
See?
To put on the hot dog.
You?
No way.
You put it on.
I'll do it, Mr. Richard.
How come you keep wanting to do things nobody wants to do?
Because I've got a can-do attitude, boss.
My dad says there's no limit to what a guy with a can-do attitude can do.
Maybe one day I'll even have your job.
The rest of my job?
Yes, sir!
You think you're so good, you put on the suit!
You put on the suit now!
Boy, it looked me like you could have cut that guy off in the last turn, but fourth place is nothing to be ashamed of.
Hang in there, Boomhauer.
You may not get to open the race tomorrow, but if there are just three accidents, you'll still get to drive that pace car.
I'll give it up, Hank.
The man's dream is no more.
No, we can't give up now.
You know, it was just the other day my boy wanted to quit his job because it was too tough.
And today, well, I think you know how this story ends up.
Bobby Hill has become the go-to guy.
Whenever I feel afraid, a ouch, a happy tune, and no one ouch.
Hey.
Bobby, what are you doing up?
It's 5.30 in the morning.
Jimmy wants me to strain the bugs out of the fryer before the oil gets too hot.
Well, you know what they say.
Find what your niche is.
That leads to riches.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, Dad.
But sometimes I still think Jimmy Richard ain't right.
Now, Bobby.
But then I remember about 110%.
That's the spirit.
And we have record attendance today with 62,457 fans.
Ah, that's a lot of people.
And it's hot.
They're gonna want drinks.
I know that!
You think I don't know that?
People are hot and dry.
They want something cold and wet.
Tell me!
It's nice, but where are the cigarette ads?
Hey, look, it's Dale Earnhardt, and he's coming this way.
Oh, it's the Terminator.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Man, this rope sure is soft and pretty.
I noticed it when we unloaded my car.
And the honorary Pace Car Driver to start the race, Officer Clint Radar Jensen, winner of the Amateur Classic 100.
Well, cars are getting good traction.
We're not going to see many crashes today.
Yep.
Yep.
So, okay, we wade this sign around and Jeff Gordon sees it then.
He comes up to us in the stands and is so taken by our charms that he asked one of us to marry him.
I know.
Honey, it probably won't be me.
I have got a ring on my finger.
Yeah, and big feet.
I'm only ignoring that because a man is on fire.
Two down, one to go.
Soda!
Get your soda!
Hey, what timing?
We're all ready for a cold soda.
I don't know that kind of Bobby's sweat on him anyway.
I just melted on him, dang it.
It's on me.
Oh, thanks.
Bobby, these sodas are hot.
Son, you gotta find a way to be more efficient.
Listen to Mr. Witcher.
He'll tell you what to do.
Okay.
Wichard?
Jimmy Wichard?
You told Bobby to listen to Jimmy Wichard?
He was in my gun club.
People say he fried his brain one day just staring at the sun.
Of course he couldn't have been too smart to do that in the first place.
It's kind of a chicken egg thing.
Make me thirsty.
I need a soda.
Hey!
Hey you!
Tommy!
I need a soda!
Yes, Mr. Richard!
Not that way!
Just run across!
Put the track!
Don't back talk to boss man!
Did you never cross the highway?
Run where there ain't any cars!
They're going too fast!
Do it, you monkey boy!
I'm the boss of you!
What the hell?
Bobby, no!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna cross the track and bring Mr. Witcher to soda.
That's crazy.
Why would you do something like that?
I'm giving 110%, Dad.
Go to here, go to, boy!
I want a soda!
Go to now, you!
Oh!
You're up!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Bang!
Yeah!
You can't get me!
Hey Bobby, whatcha doin'?
Playin' a video game?
Uh, okay.
Uh, I just wanted to say, I shoulda listened to you when you said how bad that witchard guy was.
I almost died, I'd rather not talk about it.
Bobby, you worked harder this month than any guy on this block, and I wanna give you the money you earned.
Dad, I don't want money.
I was happy before when you just bought all the stuff around here and there was no money involved.
Well, still I'd like to give you a couple hundred dollars.
I tell you what, just buy me a couple of pairs of short pants, and we'll call it even.
Do it, you monkey boy!
