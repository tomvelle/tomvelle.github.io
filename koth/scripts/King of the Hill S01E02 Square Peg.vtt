WEBVTT

00:37.308 --> 00:45.458
I'm in my office.

00:45.999 --> 00:49.724
Peggy, I've got a situation here.

00:49.744 --> 00:54.410
Oh, Hank, is it your back again?

00:54.450 --> 00:58.034
Why won't you wear that weightlifting belt I got you for Christmas?

00:58.375 --> 01:00.037
It's not a belt, it's a girdle.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.640
Take off your shirt, I'll get the icy hot.

01:06.923 --> 01:13.933
Ooh, ah, icy, icy, ah, hot, ah.

01:14.433 --> 01:14.894
All right.

01:15.114 --> 01:16.156
Okay.

01:16.716 --> 01:16.796
Hey.

01:16.816 --> 01:18.779
Peggy, not in front of the B.O.Y.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.583
I need both of you to sign this permission slip.

01:21.603 --> 01:22.084
Alrighty.

01:22.524 --> 01:23.546
What's it for, son?

01:24.267 --> 01:25.288
Contact football?

01:25.809 --> 01:26.970
No, you're not old enough for that.

01:27.571 --> 01:29.033
Ringworm test?

01:29.165 --> 01:29.506
What?

01:30.067 --> 01:31.128
Sexual education?

01:31.870 --> 01:32.791
Where'd you get this?

01:33.152 --> 01:34.314
I told you, at school.

01:34.655 --> 01:37.480
Oh, I thought we didn't have to worry about this until ninth grade health class.

01:38.081 --> 01:38.241
Uh-uh.

01:38.622 --> 01:42.588
Principal wants to teach us a unit from some course they made up in Washington, D.C.

01:42.849 --> 01:43.490
Washington?

01:44.111 --> 01:45.153
Bobby, go to your room.

01:48.379 --> 01:49.601
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:50.001 --> 01:51.424
Here's the first thing I'm gonna do.

01:51.504 --> 01:52.225
I'll tell you what.

01:53.167 --> 01:53.788
There.

01:54.308 --> 02:00.235
No need for Bobby to get all bothered up learning about sex when he can't do a damn thing about it anyway at his age.

02:00.936 --> 02:02.218
And with his features.

02:03.339 --> 02:08.025
Besides, it is not up to the United States government to be teaching Bobby the facts of life.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.847
That's his parents' job.

02:10.288 --> 02:10.748
I agree.

02:11.229 --> 02:16.075
If anybody should teach our boy about that, it should be his parents.

02:16.175 --> 02:19.319
Something like that should be taught in the home.

02:19.720 --> 02:19.940
Uh-huh.

02:20.180 --> 02:21.722
Where he lives.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.723
Absolutely.

02:23.124 --> 02:24.045
Yes, sir.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.178
Well, you're the expert.

02:29.699 --> 02:33.606
Substitute teacher of the year 1996, as I recall.

02:34.007 --> 02:36.250
Oh, Hank, I'm also a decent woman.

02:38.054 --> 02:39.757
I got my back out here, Peg.

02:43.263 --> 02:47.690
Bobby?

02:49.894 --> 02:51.096
Bobby, honey?

02:52.932 --> 02:55.295
What do you know about sexual relations?

02:56.116 --> 02:56.677
I don't know.

02:57.317 --> 02:58.078
Nothing much.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.803
I'm a little worried about being a slut.

03:02.303 --> 03:02.544
Uh-huh.

03:03.925 --> 03:12.035
Well, Bobby, your father and I decided that as your parents, that you and I should have a little talk on the subject.

03:13.597 --> 03:19.304
You have noticed, I am sure, that there are some pretty big differences between boys and girls.

03:21.407 --> 03:22.568
I'm sure you know that.

03:23.746 --> 03:28.776
I mean, physically, boys are, they're different.

03:28.796 --> 03:31.581
They have something that girls do not have.

03:32.483 --> 03:32.924
Yeah.

03:33.866 --> 03:36.731
You know, some thing.

03:37.914 --> 03:39.156
You mean a penis?

03:45.717 --> 03:47.600
I didn't take sex ed in school.

03:48.181 --> 03:50.665
Come on, Boomhauer, if you're gonna prune, prune.

03:51.086 --> 03:54.833
The army taught me everything, and in four different languages too.

03:55.113 --> 03:57.277
Want to know how to get a bar girl in the Philippines?

03:57.537 --> 04:04.910
The point is, there's no way my son is learning the how-tos of romance from some bureaucrat regulatory handbook.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.713
Sumay Ho.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.275
or something like that.

04:08.295 --> 04:11.338
And Dale, I'd say the same applies to your Joseph.

04:11.358 --> 04:13.621
I'd tear that permission slip up if I were you.

04:13.961 --> 04:15.423
I'll do that and then some.

04:15.743 --> 04:18.386
This sex head stuff goes higher than the schools.

04:18.787 --> 04:24.594
It's that same old club of Rone Zero population bull dink that the UN's been trying for years.

04:24.774 --> 04:30.220
I'll tell you what, man, it branch-fishing, it's going down, it's going to get y'all with your heads up.

04:31.297 --> 04:34.643
They want to whittle us down so we can't keep a standing army.

04:35.164 --> 04:37.648
That's when the Chinese will come marching in.

04:38.410 --> 04:41.816
All I'm saying is keep the government out of the bedroom business.

04:42.417 --> 04:45.423
Teaching my boy the facts of life is my job.

04:45.763 --> 04:45.883
Damn.

04:45.984 --> 04:47.426
You got that right.

04:48.328 --> 04:49.570
Hank, I couldn't get the words out.

04:50.231 --> 04:53.457
Oh gee, you didn't send her into a man's job, did you?

04:53.572 --> 04:57.497
Uh, well, uh... Maybe you should let Boom Howard teach him what he knows.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.902
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, he'd tell him about him dang old condom dispenser with them.

05:01.022 --> 05:06.930
He'd put a little 50 cents in there and he'd try to hit that corner, turn his bang on that thing and just talk about her needs.

05:08.052 --> 05:09.354
Oh, no, that's all right.

05:10.295 --> 05:11.256
I guess I'll do it.

05:11.897 --> 05:16.744
My daddy told me the facts of life when I was Bobby's age and I turned out okay.

05:19.492 --> 05:20.935
EHA!

05:21.275 --> 05:22.417
Hey, what you crying for, boy?

05:22.758 --> 05:23.579
It's a good show.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.142
This was a damn good show.

05:25.523 --> 05:25.903
Yeah.

05:26.845 --> 05:31.714
That's also how he taught me about paying taxes.

05:31.734 --> 05:34.458
Well, there used to be a dairy farm out here somewhere.

05:34.478 --> 05:35.781
Oh, there we go.

05:39.688 --> 05:41.411
Gracie, this is Mr. Hill.

05:42.152 --> 05:44.436
Brought his son over to learn the facts of life.

05:44.602 --> 05:46.405
Well, he sure came to the right place.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.909
We call this machine the Matchmaker 500.

05:49.369 --> 05:58.964
Now Bobby, you're coming to a time in your life when you're going to start to have tender feelings for a girl.

05:59.926 --> 06:04.433
You're going to need to know what those feelings mean and what to do about them.

06:09.796 --> 06:12.218
Where's the other half of that dang permission slip?

06:12.479 --> 06:14.281
I'm sure they will do a good job at school.

06:14.661 --> 06:16.423
The health teacher is a trained professional.

06:16.763 --> 06:17.103
Uh-huh.

06:17.584 --> 06:18.124
Keep digging.

06:21.428 --> 06:25.292
Hey Hank, I wouldn't sweat it anymore about that sex ed stuff.

06:25.312 --> 06:25.892
What do you mean?

06:26.973 --> 06:31.238
All you gotta know is I took care of it with one little phone call.

06:35.022 --> 06:36.343
Hey, pig leg.

06:37.015 --> 06:38.216
That was Bobby's principal.

06:38.817 --> 06:42.560
Some right-wing maniac just called the health teacher with a death threat and she quit.

06:42.941 --> 06:46.364
Oh, well, I'm sure it was just some harmless nutcase.

06:46.645 --> 06:48.226
Damn, thank you, God.

06:48.246 --> 06:49.607
Jeez!

06:49.627 --> 06:56.214
Hey, on the bright side, since there's no one to teach that sex ed course, we can put all this ugliness back in the closet.

06:56.594 --> 06:58.136
Oh, no, Hank, they found someone.

06:58.716 --> 07:01.019
They found the substitute teacher of the year.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.640
Uh, 1995?

07:02.660 --> 07:06.364
1996.

07:09.398 --> 07:33.786
oh my oh lord oh for goodness sake this beauty school homework is hard Aunt Peggy Aunt Peggy huh oh I'm sorry Lou Ann I was not paying attention listen to this chapter title the 14 stages of arousal and then you turn the page and

07:34.019 --> 07:34.920
Oh my goodness.

07:35.401 --> 07:37.143
Is that Sea Everett Coop?

07:37.163 --> 07:40.667
That must be an old book, because now there's 18 stages.

07:41.088 --> 07:41.468
Oh my.

07:42.049 --> 07:44.913
How am I going to say these words out loud in front of a class?

07:45.253 --> 07:45.774
Let me see.

07:46.855 --> 07:52.262
Self-exploration is a perfectly natural exercise throughout the pubescence.

07:52.282 --> 07:53.344
What's so hard about that?

07:53.724 --> 07:54.105
Luanne?

07:54.946 --> 07:58.490
Honey, tell me, what is it like to live without shame of any kind?

07:59.231 --> 08:00.172
Is it a good feeling?

08:01.934 --> 08:02.355
Yeah.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.947
Well, I guess I am a little jealous.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.069
Things were very different when I was a girl.

08:08.770 --> 08:11.653
Honey, you're at that special time of life.

08:12.353 --> 08:15.076
The time when a little girl becomes a woman.

08:15.837 --> 08:18.039
And you start getting a monthly visitor.

08:19.041 --> 08:19.281
Who?

08:19.881 --> 08:20.462
Uncle Joe?

08:22.404 --> 08:24.266
My mother gave me this and I'm passing it on to you.

08:26.268 --> 08:27.910
The loveliness of woman.

08:29.732 --> 08:32.595
There's nothing in here but pictures of flowers.

08:33.132 --> 08:35.508
I never even kissed a boy until I was twenty.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.843
Of course he's dead now.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.864
Look, here's a chapter on communicating your needs to your love partner.

08:44.645 --> 08:46.628
What kind of filth are you reading?

08:46.868 --> 08:48.450
It's Aunt Payee's sex headbook.

08:48.791 --> 08:49.412
Say what?

08:49.852 --> 08:50.834
Let me take a look at that.

08:51.595 --> 08:52.737
What in the hell?

08:53.418 --> 08:55.341
That is the inside of a womb.

08:55.942 --> 08:56.763
A woman's womb.

08:57.584 --> 09:00.328
My boy is not going to look at the inside of a womb.

09:00.729 --> 09:02.752
He's only been out of yours for 11 years.

09:03.212 --> 09:04.995
I think I need some water.

09:05.262 --> 09:07.686
You want my Chandler or my Ross?

09:08.107 --> 09:09.950
Can I shoot him full of BB's?

09:10.511 --> 09:10.952
Okay.

09:11.413 --> 09:12.174
Then Ross.

09:13.797 --> 09:14.979
You sure you don't want him?

09:15.500 --> 09:15.701
Uh huh.

09:16.121 --> 09:17.965
I'm not gonna need my toys anymore.

09:18.345 --> 09:21.030
After I learn sex ed, I'll be too busy dating.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.112
Who?

09:23.294 --> 09:23.855
I don't know.

09:24.817 --> 09:26.680
Whoever wants to have sex with me.

09:27.925 --> 09:29.026
Well, what do you think?

09:29.407 --> 09:30.769
A few more inches?

09:30.789 --> 09:31.449
Might as well.

09:31.650 --> 09:32.611
Just gonna keep growing.

09:33.112 --> 09:35.134
Well, so much for my phone call.

09:35.154 --> 09:36.075
What are you talking about?

09:36.276 --> 09:40.020
They found some other deep-fraved harlot to teach that six-ed class.

09:40.661 --> 09:41.422
Uh, Dale?

09:41.482 --> 09:42.604
Don't worry, Hank.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.568
I know people who can take care of this woman if you know what I mean.

09:45.868 --> 09:47.350
That woman is my wife.

09:47.951 --> 09:49.833
I thought Peggy was your wife.

09:49.853 --> 09:53.798
Dale, I think he's saying Peggy's the new sex teacher.

10:00.865 --> 10:01.606
Yeah, what?

10:02.327 --> 10:02.847
Nothing.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.649
I wouldn't say nothing at all, Hank.

10:04.769 --> 10:07.492
You did nothing wrong with a little sexual education?

10:07.772 --> 10:08.493
No, sir.

10:08.833 --> 10:12.377
I bet Peggy'll be introducing some new ideas into the bedroom.

10:12.718 --> 10:13.338
Dale!

10:13.358 --> 10:16.421
I'm just saying a woman who knows is the toughest customer.

10:16.962 --> 10:18.544
Maybe you ought to hit the books, too.

10:18.804 --> 10:20.706
What the hell is wrong with you all?

10:20.886 --> 10:22.808
What nothing, Hank, just think.

10:23.289 --> 10:27.433
You'll be married to a woman who knows everything about sex.

10:27.453 --> 10:29.235
I've never been with a woman like that.

10:30.143 --> 10:32.150
Except, of course, a bar girl.

10:32.190 --> 10:38.129
Of course, I don't mean that Peggy's a bar girl or nothing like that.

10:38.150 --> 10:43.427
I mean, she just knows, you know, what a bar girl knows.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.983
You know, there's a funny thing happening down at school.

10:49.624 --> 10:58.174
They want me to teach this sex ed stuff to our kids class, you know, but I just don't know if I can overcome the crippling sense of shame that I got from my mother.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.195
Phew!

10:59.215 --> 11:00.857
Well, we knew you wouldn't.

11:00.877 --> 11:08.226
Yeah, I've been telling people Peggy Hill is not one of those teachers that puts all that intellectual hooey above common decency.

11:09.547 --> 11:09.688
Mm-hmm.

11:09.708 --> 11:09.988
Well...

11:10.610 --> 11:13.955
Well, sometimes a little intellectual hooey is a good thing.

11:14.416 --> 11:19.404
Look, we all grew up not knowing the real words for your dinky and your woohoo, and we turned out fine.

11:19.785 --> 11:21.367
I learned about sex from my mother.

11:21.387 --> 11:24.893
She gave me that wonderful book, The Loveliness of Woman.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.115
That book is worthless.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.517
Well, I got a lot out of it.

11:27.938 --> 11:34.929
When my husband would crawl all over me at night and do his business, well, I would just close my eyes and think of them pretty flowers.

11:35.590 --> 11:36.972
Oh, Bonnie, you poor, poor woman.

11:39.736 --> 11:42.722
Hey Bobby, your mom's gonna teach sex ed.

11:43.183 --> 11:43.864
Yeah, I know.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.311
We're gonna get to see your boobs.

11:49.335 --> 11:49.696
So?

11:50.438 --> 11:51.159
Bobby, you're up!

11:54.887 --> 11:56.530
Your dad lost his job.

11:59.632 --> 12:00.313
Run, run!

12:00.353 --> 12:01.114
Come on, run!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.658
Don't stop at first bite, son!

12:03.678 --> 12:04.659
Go on the way, Bobby!

12:04.859 --> 12:05.761
Go on the way, honey!

12:05.921 --> 12:15.034
Yeah, yeah, go all the way, you perv!

12:15.054 --> 12:15.274
Hello?

12:15.775 --> 12:23.426
You don't know who I am, but I know where you live, and if you teach that six-head class, so help me out.

12:23.446 --> 12:23.586
Dale?

12:24.207 --> 12:24.848
Is that you?

12:25.569 --> 12:28.373
Oh, hey, uh, can I speak with Peggy?

12:28.555 --> 12:29.836
Uh, Peggy, it's for you.

12:30.177 --> 12:30.717
It's Dale.

12:32.038 --> 12:32.979
Yellow, Dale.

12:32.999 --> 12:36.743
You don't know who I am, but I know where you live.

12:38.744 --> 12:40.286
Boy, you should have heard Bonnie today.

12:40.646 --> 12:43.629
That woman has got one awful love life.

12:43.649 --> 12:45.371
Uh-huh.

12:45.391 --> 12:46.171
Oh, my God.

12:47.473 --> 12:48.253
Hi, Aunt Coney.

12:48.774 --> 12:51.536
Would you like to rub some pretty feet and hands on my back?

12:52.057 --> 12:54.459
Uh, isn't that just for your feet and hands?

12:54.919 --> 12:55.700
Well, mainly.

12:56.181 --> 12:57.702
But you could use it everywhere.

12:57.766 --> 12:58.507
I'll pass.

12:59.107 --> 13:01.150
Well, how about if I put a little on your elbows?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.472
It'll moisturize and exfoliate.

13:03.773 --> 13:05.114
My elbows are fine.

13:05.134 --> 13:07.016
You never complained about them before.

13:07.056 --> 13:09.459
It's just that it's so nice and cooling.

13:09.879 --> 13:11.461
It makes your elbows smooth.

13:11.842 --> 13:12.102
What?

13:12.582 --> 13:16.166
Where in the hell are my elbows gonna be that they need to be smooth?

13:16.447 --> 13:20.631
Well, honey, I just thought it would be nice, you know, for later, for us to be all smooth.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.875
I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but I'll pass.

13:25.289 --> 13:30.158
Look, Hank Hill, I did not ask to teach this class, but I am a substitute teacher.

13:30.759 --> 13:39.235
That means I have to be prepared to go wherever they need teachers most, at any hour of the day or night, and teach anything from gym to home ec.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.079
I took an oath, darn it.

13:41.379 --> 13:41.860
Excuse me.

13:42.281 --> 13:46.048
And if I start to pick and choose, the whole system just breaks down.

13:46.028 --> 13:51.134
Yeah, well, you weren't too proud to pick and choose when you had those Randy Travis tickets.

13:51.654 --> 13:55.819
Oh, no, those poor little kids never did get to make their clay ash trays.

13:56.219 --> 14:02.586
Well, they're damn sure gonna know the 18 stages of arousal, because Peggy Hill is gonna teach that class.

14:08.433 --> 14:12.998
This is a diagram of a woman's...

14:13.855 --> 14:17.084
Come on Aunt Peggy, you can do it!

14:17.505 --> 14:29.637
A woman's the... This is a man's...

14:45.715 --> 14:47.037
Well, what do you think?

14:48.339 --> 14:52.945
Mm-hmm, nice and clean, but I think old Sigmund Freud might have a thing or two to say about it.

14:53.285 --> 14:54.647
What?

14:54.667 --> 14:55.308
Oh, no!

14:57.671 --> 14:58.132
Happiness.

14:59.514 --> 15:00.615
Happiness.

15:02.177 --> 15:05.021
Happiness.

15:05.041 --> 15:09.107
Happiness.

15:10.949 --> 15:11.330
I did it.

15:12.752 --> 15:13.613
Overease.

15:14.605 --> 15:15.727
You villa.

15:17.109 --> 15:17.509
Urus.

15:18.631 --> 15:22.416
Vagina!

15:22.436 --> 15:24.519
Hey Hank, I just said- I heard you.

15:24.740 --> 15:26.723
The whole neighborhood can hear you cussing.

15:26.963 --> 15:29.787
It's not cussing Hank to say the name of a God-given body part.

15:29.947 --> 15:34.514
Well it is if it's a part of the body that was meant to be concealed by an undergarment.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.538
You're dealing with organs that people just don't want to know about.

15:37.799 --> 15:39.501
Well Bobby ought to know about them.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.165
We don't want him growing up as repressed as we did.

15:42.145 --> 15:42.926
Sure we do.

15:43.046 --> 15:44.689
I'm drawing the line here, Peggy.

15:45.009 --> 15:47.553
My son is not going to learn this crazy crap.

15:47.933 --> 15:52.179
It says right here he can't take the class without permission of both his parents.

15:52.420 --> 15:53.561
Now, just hold on.

15:53.842 --> 15:56.666
Are you saying I am not good enough to teach my own son?

15:57.046 --> 16:00.151
If you do not approve, you do not have to sign.

16:00.211 --> 16:01.272
And I do not approve.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.434
Permission denied.

16:02.454 --> 16:06.600
This damn strapping tape.

16:14.714 --> 16:15.495
Come on, Bobby.

16:15.715 --> 16:16.977
You're coming to work with me.

16:33.260 --> 16:38.708
Uh, no, Mr. Hudson, we don't recommend using propane to fill party balloons.

16:39.889 --> 16:43.995
Well, yeah, it is a gas, but it's in a liquid state.

16:44.431 --> 16:47.515
Well, okay, but you might want to blow out those candles.

16:48.336 --> 16:49.778
Look, I'm gonna have to call you back.

16:50.078 --> 16:52.100
Bobby, hey, that's my work.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.702
Now just sit still, okay?

16:55.404 --> 16:57.687
What do you think mom's telling all those guys?

16:58.148 --> 16:58.688
I don't know.

16:58.829 --> 17:00.090
I don't want to know.

17:00.571 --> 17:02.052
Just try not to think about it.

17:03.274 --> 17:03.694
Okay.

17:06.538 --> 17:08.560
What do you think mom's saying to him?

17:08.600 --> 17:10.142
I said not to think about it.

17:10.643 --> 17:12.045
Think about something else.

17:12.786 --> 17:13.206
Okay.

17:15.818 --> 17:18.543
Dad, do you ever have sex anymore?

17:19.726 --> 17:24.535
Uh... Well, uh... Come on, Bobby.

17:24.595 --> 17:26.399
Can't you think of something pleasant?

17:29.244 --> 17:37.641
What do you think mom's telling all those guys?

17:43.544 --> 17:44.365
Good morning class.

17:44.866 --> 17:47.670
Today we're gonna discuss the subject of human relations.

17:48.411 --> 17:53.678
Otherwise known as... Human relations.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.000
I am your substitute teacher.

17:55.521 --> 17:56.562
My name is Peggy Hill.

17:58.465 --> 17:59.146
Oh, kiddokey.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.129
Any questions so far?

18:03.733 --> 18:04.113
Dad?

18:04.594 --> 18:04.914
What?

18:05.655 --> 18:10.362
I just wanted to say you don't have to worry about me because I'm never gonna have sex.

18:10.409 --> 18:12.351
Oh, Bobby, now don't say that.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.514
I thought that's what you wanted.

18:14.835 --> 18:18.119
Well, yes, if you were my daughter, but you're my son.

18:19.721 --> 18:23.325
Why is it not okay for girls, but it's okay for boys?

18:23.906 --> 18:25.869
It's called the double standard, Bobby.

18:25.929 --> 18:26.570
Don't knock it.

18:26.650 --> 18:28.833
We got the long end of the stick on that one.

18:29.533 --> 18:30.034
I see.

18:30.074 --> 18:33.919
That's why mom's bad for talking about sex.

18:34.422 --> 18:39.571
Bobby, look, just because your mom's been using those words doesn't mean she's bad.

18:40.292 --> 18:41.835
She's just trying to do her job.

18:42.476 --> 18:45.902
Give the kids the proper names for things.

18:45.922 --> 18:56.481
Imagine how hard that is for your mother, trying to teach a room full of snicker and fifth graders the difference between a boy and a girl's, uh, you know, hookups.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.001
That woman's got a lot of guts, I'll tell you what.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.866
That's Mrs. Peggy Hill.

19:06.088 --> 19:09.273
H-I-L-L.

19:10.174 --> 19:13.899
You can call me Mrs. Hill, you can call me Peggy, or Peggy Hill.

19:17.004 --> 19:18.666
Okay, come on Peggy Hill, you can do this.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.413
Okay, today's subject.

19:26.448 --> 19:27.470
Just have a seat.

19:28.051 --> 19:30.815
I'm sure your teacher can tell you everything you need to know.

19:31.917 --> 19:36.324
She was a substitute teacher of the year 1996, I understand.

19:36.384 --> 19:41.292
Alright class, let's do it.

19:42.234 --> 19:43.877
Today I'm going to teach you sex ed.

19:44.558 --> 19:52.050
It's difficult subject matter, but if we approach it with common sense, I believe we might learn something that could enrich our lives.

19:52.148 --> 19:55.233
But before we begin, please bring your permission slips up to my desk.

19:55.834 --> 20:00.561
And those of you whose parents did not give you permission to learn with me, well, you can read for an hour in the school library.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.083
Sorry, Peggy.

20:02.103 --> 20:02.444
Sorry, Peggy.

20:02.464 --> 20:02.904
Sorry, Peggy.

20:02.925 --> 20:03.465
Sorry, Peggy.

20:03.746 --> 20:04.948
Sorry, Peggy.

20:04.968 --> 20:05.308
Sorry, Peggy.

20:05.328 --> 20:05.589
Sorry, Peggy.

20:05.609 --> 20:05.869
Sorry, Peggy.

20:05.889 --> 20:06.149
Sorry, Peggy.

20:06.169 --> 20:06.430
Sorry, Peggy.

20:06.450 --> 20:06.710
Sorry, Peggy.

20:06.730 --> 20:07.011
Sorry, Peggy.

20:07.031 --> 20:07.552
Sorry, Peggy.

20:07.572 --> 20:07.872
Sorry, Peggy.

20:07.892 --> 20:08.313
Sorry, Peggy.

20:08.333 --> 20:08.633
Sorry, Peggy.

20:08.653 --> 20:09.875
Sorry, Peggy.

20:09.895 --> 20:10.156
Sorry, Peggy.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.760
Sorry, Peggy.

20:12.780 --> 20:13.040
Sorry, Peggy.

20:13.060 --> 20:13.461
Sorry, Peggy.

20:13.501 --> 20:13.921
Sorry, Peggy.

20:13.941 --> 20:14.202
Sorry, Peggy.

20:14.262 --> 20:14.582
Sorry, Peggy.

20:14.803 --> 20:15.223
Sorry, Peggy.

20:15.243 --> 20:15.584
Sorry, Peggy.

20:15.604 --> 20:15.864
Sorry, Peggy.

20:15.884 --> 20:16.145
Sorry, Peggy.

20:16.165 --> 20:16.425
Sorry, Peggy.

20:16.445 --> 20:16.846
Sorry, Peggy.

20:16.886 --> 20:17.387
Sorry, Peggy.

20:17.407 --> 20:18.448
Sorry, Peggy.

20:18.468 --> 20:18.729
Sorry, Peggy.

20:18.749 --> 20:19.009
Sorry, Peggy.

20:19.029 --> 20:19.290
Sorry, Peggy.

20:19.310 --> 20:19.590
Sorry, Peggy.

20:22.658 --> 20:23.279
Hello?

20:24.400 --> 20:24.900
Bobby?

20:26.101 --> 20:26.702
Luanne?

20:27.683 --> 20:28.504
Was anybody home?

20:29.645 --> 20:30.446
Where is everybody?

20:31.106 --> 20:34.029
Uh, I sent the kids off to see a double feature.

20:35.170 --> 20:40.455
May I have this dance?

20:43.618 --> 20:46.421
Smooth elbows, Peg.

20:46.441 --> 20:49.424
I seem to recall you kind of like being dipped.

20:49.444 --> 20:50.065
Oh, hi.

20:50.505 --> 20:51.266
Watch your back.

20:51.606 --> 20:52.547
Good as ever.

20:54.451 --> 20:58.937
Are you okay?

20:59.617 --> 21:02.281
Well, as long as we're down here.

21:03.763 --> 21:14.356
Hello, you have reached the Hill residence.

21:14.376 --> 21:16.138
Please leave a message at the toe.

21:17.350 --> 21:26.305
You don't know who I am, but I know where you live, sex ed teacher, and you better cut it out if you know what's good for you.

21:26.346 --> 21:32.456
Oh, and uh, hey, we changed that tee off time to three o'clock.

21:32.476 --> 21:32.997
See ya.
