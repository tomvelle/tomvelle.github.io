Merry Christmas, gentlemen.
So, Hank, what's with the black suit?
Someone die?
Oh, right.
Someone did die.
You're mom's best friend, as I recall.
Well, this is awkward.
Merry Christmas.
That was Lottie Bonner's lawyer.
Lottie left me all her lovely antique furniture.
I'm so touched.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
So your best bet is, you know, neither.
Oh, of course I'll never be able to get it all back to Arizona.
Heck, Mom, I can move that stuff out to Arizona for you easy.
Oh, but... I will be at your door by Christmas Eve.
Heck, all I have to do is rent a moving van.
Oh Hank, are you sure Van is big enough?
That is a big van.
No more, no more inside of that old shit.
I'm going to name her Wondertruck.
Ask him, ask him.
Hank, we want to ask you one question.
You can't come with me on the trip.
I have a follow-up question.
The next one who asks to come won't even get to look at it.
Okay then.
I know it's more cargo space than I need, but, uh, well, there's a sleeper cab, so I'll save on motels and, you know, uh... Hey, you don't have to explain to us.
Wow!
Look at all this cool stuff!
This isn't a toy, Bobby.
To a trucker, these are tools.
See, truckers are the last cowboys.
They're their own bosses making tough decisions, winning or losing by the calls they make, answering only to the road.
Sounds hard!
It is.
Now, how would you like to make this trip with your old man?
Heck yeah!
Dad, can I have permission to say hell yeah?
Just a moment.
It's such a fine night to look at the moon.
Look how big and powerful the moon looks in the moonlight.
Ready for its trip to Arizona.
It's just not fair.
The moon, I mean.
This is a dream come true.
A trucker and his boy alone with their rig on the open road.
But don't worry, Peggy.
We'll do a quick turnaround and be back home by Christmas morning sharp.
A trucker and his boy.
And they've promised their mom to be home by Christmas.
Hank, this is one of those novelty Christmas songs that always sells a million freaking copies.
I have always wanted to get in on that racket.
Okay, let's roll.
Well, alright.
Okay, Bobby, we gotta stay on time, so drink up and let's hit the road.
Coffee?
For me?
I don't think I can ever go back to Coco!
You see, trucking is like a lot of things in life.
Know your rig inside out, take care of your rig, and she'll take care of you.
Dad, you know everything.
Well, I do have a Class C license.
We're stowing away.
We're stowing away.
We're so bad.
Oh, hey, man, look at that.
Man, it's just like a block block of guy.
They don't bend her, man.
Oh, wow.
Oh, look at that view.
This is probably how it looked to the very first truckers.
Now, the trick to heading up a steep grade is to shift gears carefully.
And why is that?
A trucker always protects his cargo.
My dearest Nancy, I have many questions about the outside world.
Is our government still intact?
And what of young Joseph?
Gentlemen, to your racers.
He won us who?
No.
Hank and Bobby in a Christmas truck.
Oh, dang it.
They're just no good words that rhyme with truck.
Aunt Peggy, could they be delivering a snowman?
I bet there's lots of words that rhyme with snowman.
Of course, who needs a snowman more than a widow in Arizona?
Our song will be about Hank and Bobby delivering a snowman to a war man with no man.
I'm a songwriter!
The second largest thermometer in the U.S.
Do we have time to stop?
Well, we have to be home by Christmas so we can stop or we can go to a truck stop and chow down like real truckers.
Chow down like real truckers!
Well, alright then.
Eh, you can see the thermometer from here anyway.
105 degrees.
Wow!
Hank, for God's sakes, let us out!
It's so hot!
No, Hank hears us, but he's choosing to punish us.
Rightly so.
What's the use?
At the rate I'm smokin', we only have about 30 minutes of oxygen left anyway.
Oh, man, I'm dang old, I'm dang old, dang old, dang old, dang old water, man.
We brought food.
Maybe we can squeeze moisture out of it.
Let's see, chips.
Barbecue chips, vinegar flavor, hot and spicy, saltines, no!
I didn't want to describe it to you because, well, how could I?
See, for truckers, time is money.
We can't spend time waiting in a line with the civilians.
We keep to a schedule.
Yep, just rode in from Arlen, Texas on a straight shot.
How about you?
Well, I guess I'm coming in straight from old Eastern Long Island.
Guess this would be my first meal in 40 hours or so.
Yep, I hear that.
OK.
So what are you boys hauling anyway?
A sofa for my grandma!
Sir, this section is for truckers only.
Buffs like you taking up space cost real truckers money.
Go on.
Huh?
But dad, I thought you said we were truckers.
We are.
I don't mean to spoil your fun, sir, but you're not a trucker.
You're just a guy with a truck.
You think I'm not a trucker while I drove through El Paso in rush hour and didn't grind a gear.
Look at my rig, perfectly maintained from the back bumper to the grille.
Hank!
Oh!
Hey, Hank!
We're not gonna drink bill after all, okay?
Waiter, table for five!
We're sorry, Hank.
We'll sit quietly back here if you give us a water dish to drink from.
We'll be as quiet as truck mice.
Get in the cab.
Fixing this hole you made has put me off schedule, so I'll skip my bunk time and drive all night.
Now get moving.
This is the saga our song will tell.
Hank and Bobby find a snowman hitchhiking through Arizona.
He will melt to death unless he gets home to the North Pole by Christmas.
Hank and Bobby take him home.
The snowman's family is so grateful they invite them to their Christmas snowman dinner.
You got it?
Oh, no.
It's okay to take a nap, Dad.
If we're half a day late, Grandma won't mind.
Well, I will.
We've got a promise to your mother to keep.
We are getting back home by Christmas morning.
Duck.
Duck.
Goose!
What?
I'll get him, Hank!
I ain't gonna... You get him, Hank!
Shut it!
Hey!
And that's how the Christmas snowman got back home!
You don't like it.
Oh, it's not that, Shuggs.
It's just that I've got a lot of other things on my mind, like, I don't know where my husband is.
Oh, I'm sure Dale is fine.
Now, how can we fix this all?
We tried your way, Aunt Peggy.
Now we should do my way.
We have differences, like when Simon versus the Garfunkel.
Look how straight the lines on the highway are.
It'd be easy to get highway hypnosis.
Bill, you are getting sleepy.
It's working.
I'm so sleepy.
Man, make him think like a dangled chicken, man.
Hey, Dad!
Look!
I was awake.
What?
Look at the sign.
Truck stopped four miles.
We can get you some coffee.
Bobby, it would take too long to tie him up, so I'm gonna need you to get the coffee.
Which line?
Trucker?
Trucker.
Dad, they wouldn't let me on the trucker line for moral reasons, but... I guess playing trucker takes a lot out of ya.
At least now he can tell all the other accountants he slept at a real truck stop.
Okay, let's get a move out.
Now, if we make up for the lost time while my dad's asleep, he'll wake up ahead of schedule.
Mr. Broomhauer, are you sure you're able to handle this vehicle?
Hey, man, that ain't no piece of cake, man.
What you like riding down by riding more than a forklift, you know?
Just like they don't line the same as KitKat, man.
14-foot clearance.
How tall is the truck?
Probably don't.
I don't know Bobby.
I don't know.
It's awfully big.
I'd say 30 feet tall at least.
Boom hour, get off now!
Left side!
This is the wrong way, turn around!
Hey, man, you see them dang old sides of this thing, man?
They won't talk about a little turn around, man.
It can't do... Ooh, there's another agent!
Take it!
Well, this feels good, doesn't it?
Well, Mom, that's the last of it.
Hank, this is the best Christmas ever.
Ready?
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light.
Dawn's early light.
Dawn's early light.
What the... Where?
Hank, we're having trouble with the engine and the clutch.
Oh, and we're on top of a mountain.
I think it might be a rocky mountain.
What the hell happened?
Let's just say mistakes were made.
Then other larger mistakes.
We're not proud of ourselves.
I'm sorry, Dad.
We thought if we kept driving, we could help you make your delivery on time.
We didn't even stop for a potty break.
I had to use your coffee mug.
Dale, get behind the line of shame.
Not you, Bobby.
I know you were trying to help.
Hank, we're cold!
Can we put our hands down?
No.
Okay, we're out of fuel.
That part I can understand.
But how did you let the battery go dead?
It was dark and the headlights made us feel so safe.
Breaker 1033, this is Top Hat.
Requesting emergency.
No, Bobby.
I don't want to bother real truckers with the problems of a guy who fell asleep and let his rig wind up on top of a mountain.
What are you doing, Dad?
I'm gonna call AAA, and probably hire some movers, too.
It's time to let the professionals handle this.
No, sure we're in a hole.
But real truckers are in a hole all the time, and they don't give up.
They figure out a way to get through.
You're not just a guy with a truck, Dad.
Okay, everybody, let's check out our rig and see what we've got.
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Uh, line suspended.
Yay!
And a Charlie Chaplin ceramic lamp, and these opera glasses.
That's what we have to work with.
Hank, which would you rather burn for warmth?
The dining set?
Or the frames of these tasteful landscape paintings?
Neither.
I am getting this load to my mom intact.
Hey, man, got him down old antique lamps, man.
Talk about a little kerosene left inside, man.
You know, they'll probably stay warm down on five minutes.
So, you know, talk about them down.
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
Good idea, Boomhower.
There might be some kerosene still left in those lamps to keep us warm if... Oh, wait a minute.
Bobby, hand me those opera glasses.
Perfect.
Now, if we can get the truck rolling downhill, the motion will recharge the battery.
And kerosene is close enough to diesel fuel so we can burn it.
I'll pop the clutch and we can turn around in that meadow.
I understood something about burning fuel.
Are we going to be warm?
You two are going to get warm working up a sweat digging out these tires.
Here.
Bobby, I need your help over here.
And Dale, you're, uh, at large.
Yes, sir.
Stroke!
Stroke, come on!
Now I won't be able to see from the back to steer, so you fellas will have to guide me.
Boom, how are you?
Use the CB.
It's going to be a bumpy ride, so hang on.
What keeps the furniture from sliding out the door?
Well, all our straps and chains are on the road for traction, so you do, Bill.
Good luck.
Okay, man, you got like a little curve coming up on left, how about about 15.3?
He's just swinging a little to the right now.
Okay, now he's on the cover.
About three o'clock, man, on this little bump.
Feel that, man?
Right now, now.
Couple of straight holes.
Oh, steady, man, steady, man.
How about about a right and a cut, right?
Good job, man.
How about just a little straight away, about 1.3 yards now.
You get a little curve coming up, how about a little angle left, man?
Get ready, get ready now.
Okay, I know.
Cut, man, cut, cut.
That's okay, we got all you got, man.
Left, left, left, right.
It's working!
It's working!
We only get one shot, son.
Pull.
Then some man thanked Bobby and Uncle Hank for taking him to Arizona, cause he wanted to see his friend the crippled boy.
Just one more time before he meditated.
The end.
That's my Christmas checking song.
Do you like it?
Shook, it's great, but right now I'm busy filing a missing persons report, okay?
Can you see now, Hank?
Ow!

Kitchen stop making breakfast half an hour ago.
So what can I bring you boys?
Oh, man, I dangled black coffee, man, and a little water, too.
Now, man, where's dangled restroom at me?
Whoa, slow it down, sweetheart.
OK, man, dangled black coffee, dangled water.
Well, I know that voice.
Hey, one of you boys' name, Hank.
We're just going to have our coffee and go.
We don't need any trouble.
I bet you don't.
You had no trouble getting down that mountain this morning.
Man, we've been listening on CB to you guys coming downhill on 41.
Glad y'all ain't dead.
What the hell you boys sitting over there for?
Come on over here.
All right.
Eh, Bobby?
Yeah.
All right.
Getting down hill like that took some doing.
What were you gulping on?
Reds, binnies, apple wackies?
Oh, I don't go in for the fancy-flavored coffees.
Just regular old Joe.
Man, you are old school.
Hey, little friend, how about taking a seat and telling me about that run on that hill?
Sir, much as I would love to get into it, we better get rolling.
We gotta finish our haul and get home by Christmas.
Good man, but you won't get far without your mirrors.
Or your headlights.
Yep, suppose that's true.
On the other hand, if I rode ahead of you, you wouldn't need them.
And if I get your back, I can handle your rear view for you.
You mean like a convoy?
Damn straight.
Hank Hill was a trucker and he drove to pride Before seatbelt buckle had his boy by his side He had drove with a promise and a pretty slow They took the wrong turn while trying to get back And wound up stranded in a mountain gala At a diesel in the freezing cold That ol' Hank Hill conch was rolling And the antique lords were hauling His destination momma's down the line
We was down at the eat-em-up, the boys and me drinking straight black joe When the old C.B.
got the pickin' up song Sounded down right weird He said, Hey, old Hank man, I talked about you a little tight Talked about me a little loud man, now Hank's going right Yeah, I tell ya, that us truckers pretty dang scared Then Hank pulled up feeling nothing too big We couldn't believe how he handled that rig So I said, Hell, we'll help ya out, my man
I'll call Gravel Goodman and One-Eyed and Mona will get that load out the arrows on him cause the trucker helps his mama when he can.
