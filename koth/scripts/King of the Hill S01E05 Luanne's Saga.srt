1
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,756
Just two more.

2
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:38,557
Come on.

3
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:40,019
Okay.

4
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,900
Five more.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,200
Okay.

6
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:42,662
Five more.

7
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:45,045
Hey, you said two.

8
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:46,727
You can't predict this tape.

9
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,229
I've done it enough to know.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,471
My Game Boy's out of batteries.

11
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,154
I need to get on the Nintendo.

12
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:52,834
Quick!

13
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,136
Just a minute, Bobby.

14
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,961
Get ready to turn and turn.

15
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:01,345
Way to go, Bobby.

16
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:04,969
Hi, Uncle Hank.

17
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:06,656
Uh, shut that off.

18
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:10,020
Bobby, stop dancing now.

19
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:12,003
He is not just dancing.

20
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,567
He's firming his thighs and tightening his buttocks.

21
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,568
Watch your mouth.

22
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,332
Jesus.

23
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:18,993
Ah!

24
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:19,594
Ah!

25
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:20,475
Jack!

26
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:21,597
Lou Anne!

27
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:22,798
Ah, damn it.

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,542
Ah, look at this place.

29
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:26,884
What is it, Uncle Hank?

30
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:29,688
The sofa beds in the out position.

31
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,712
And I can't find nothing in here anymore.

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,922
What are you looking for?

33
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:36,927
I didn't used to have to be looking for something.

34
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:39,471
I'd come into my den and just look.

35
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:43,158
Look at my different stuff and get ideas about what I want.

36
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:44,580
Don't worry, Uncle Hank.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,762
I'll be out of your hair soon.

38
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:49,008
I think Buckley's gonna ask me to move in.

39
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:50,190
Isn't it neat?

40
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:54,397
I'll be going from daddy to you to Buckley.

41
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:57,282
Yeah, it's an amazing journey, Lou Ann.

42
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:58,893
What about this?

43
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:00,399
Maybe you want this record?

44
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,367
No, it doesn't work like that.

45
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,275
How about this tackle box?

46
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:08,773
Luanne, what did I just... Well, that might need reorganizing.

47
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,152
Why do you let Luan go out with that hairball?

48
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,193
It's none of my business.

49
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:25,475
She's not my daughter.

50
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,960
Anyway, that Buckley may be dumb as dirt, but he's her ticket out of my house.

51
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:39,993
Keep going!

52
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,317
They should be out of my sight by now.

53
00:02:48,123 --> 00:03:04,444
And, man, in Dangle Birds, man, flying low this season, man, it's probably a dangle awkward, man, to take a look.

54
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,805
What the hell was that?

55
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,728
That was a breakup.

56
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,953
At least that's what it was the last time I ran into the house crying.

57
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:28,386
A lot of tears.

58
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,490
Guess what was on sale?

59
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,233
Oh, my lord, you've been dumped.

60
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:37,278
Oh, there, there.

61
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:43,105
All right, you tell Aunt Peggy all about it.

62
00:03:51,455 --> 00:04:01,087
Fish sticks?

63
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:04,711
Oh.

64
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,296
Hey, you know, I was almost killed at this point.

65
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,177
Okay, Hank, please.

66
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,799
Try and be sensitive.

67
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:14,464
Okay, honey.

68
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:15,585
Go ahead, you let it out.

69
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,167
It is natural.

70
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:18,829
This is the healing process.

71
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:25,098
Peggy.

72
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,680
I had a talk with her today.

73
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:30,746
We are past the first hump, so that leaves only seven more humps.

74
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,869
Peggy, I need you to fix her now.

75
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,175
Without my quiet time, I'm not an effective propane salesman.

76
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:38,998
Well, you can't rush it, Hank.

77
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:44,005
The formula is, for however long she was dating him, that's how long it takes to get over him.

78
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,488
You mean we got three more weeks of this?

79
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,272
If you don't fix her, I'll have to.

80
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:52,136
Well, honey, I don't think you have the tools for that job.

81
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:53,398
What's that supposed to mean?

82
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:58,686
Well, remember when my aunt died and you kept grabbing me around the waist and saying, let's wrestle.

83
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,508
Yeah, but you told me that helped you.

84
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:01,210
I did.

85
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,652
Well, yes, it did.

86
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:03,353
See?

87
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:08,120
Look, if you really want to help, sometime tomorrow you tell Louie and she looks pretty.

88
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,203
What's that got to do with anything?

89
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,166
She just needs to hear it from a man.

90
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:16,592
Three words, you look pretty and nothing more.

91
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:19,821
So whatcha thinkin' about there, Stu?

92
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,245
I'm thinkin' about flippin' that steak there.

93
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:23,187
Well, ratty.

94
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:23,968
No!

95
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:25,190
Flip that other one!

96
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:28,856
Don't go away.

97
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:36,790
We'll be right back with more of Make a Steak.

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,672
How you doin' out there?

99
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:38,954
I'm Chuck Manjoni.

100
00:05:39,495 --> 00:05:42,360
You know, even celebrities have to hunt for bargains.

101
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,893
That's why I go to the Megalomark, where shopping feels so good.

102
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,777
This week, twelve five pound bags of gourmet chocolates for ten dollars.

103
00:05:52,258 --> 00:06:12,195
That's Buckley's section.

104
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,056
You look pretty.

105
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:15,778
I was dumped.

106
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,821
Three words, nothing more.

107
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,362
You look pretty.

108
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:21,584
Nothing more.

109
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:24,607
Why aren't you saying anything?

110
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,591
I never liked that Buckley.

111
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:29,872
You should be happy.

112
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,395
That guy was an annoying greasy headed loser.

113
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:37,980
I was dumped by a loser.

114
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,897
Ah, jeez.

115
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,281
Luanne, sometimes life throws you a curveball.

116
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,223
Now there's two ways you can deal with it.

117
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:54,351
You can cry, and that's the path you've chosen, or you can not cry.

118
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,854
How do you not cry?

119
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:01,639
Well, instead of letting it out, try holding it in.

120
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,507
Every time you have a feeling, just stick it into a little pit inside your stomach and never let it out.

121
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,809
Are you supposed to have a pain under your rib?

122
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:15,430
Yes.

123
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,012
That's natural.

124
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,257
The body doesn't want to swallow its emotions.

125
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,242
But now you go ahead and put that pain inside your stomach, too.

126
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,546
I think it's working, Uncle Hank.

127
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,251
I feel sick, but not sad.

128
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:31,212
There you go.

129
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,175
Look at my friend Bill.

130
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:38,022
He went through the worst divorce this county's ever seen, but you never see him crying.

131
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm scared I'll never find another guy.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,142
Ah, don't worry about that.

133
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:51,344
Peggy told me.

134
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:56,192
If you dated your old boyfriend for three weeks, you'll get a new one in three weeks.

135
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,073
Tops.

136
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:04,681
Another thing I hate about Buckley, he always takes me to all you can eat and says that I have to sneak off his plate so I just get iced tea.

137
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:07,284
And then he's too scared to get caught to share.

138
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:09,828
Ooh, I hate guys like that.

139
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,072
And why do boys with braces always want a french kiss?

140
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:18,860
Uh, pass me some more of that cookie dough.

141
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:22,605
Mmm.

142
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:24,841
I never knew you could eat it raw.

143
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,046
It's almost as good as ice cream.

144
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,595
You know they make ice cream with cookie dough already in it.

145
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:36,409
Damn sister get me my keys.

146
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,331
Lou Ann, where have you been?

147
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,374
We were supposed to be crying all night.

148
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,536
I spent the whole day with Uncle Hank.

149
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,780
Lou Ann, why don't you go get the fold out ready?

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,521
OK.

151
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,563
Good night, Uncle Hank and Aunt Peggy.

152
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,145
Good night, Hank.

153
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,026
What did you do?

154
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,048
I did what you couldn't do.

155
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:55,892
Now, I'm not saying you're not good at what you do.

156
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,553
I'm just saying I'm better.

157
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:00,917
I went in there and fixed her like fixing a carburetor.

158
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,039
And you know what?

159
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,962
It was fun, like fixing a carburetor.

160
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,926
But Hank, I told you not to meddle.

161
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,214
This is a natural process and you cannot manipulate... You know, you look pretty.

162
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:12,536
Really?

163
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh, Hank.

164
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,043
Well, that's sweet.

165
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,429
But I mean it, you have got to stop... You look pretty, Peg.

166
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:21,533
Oh, thank you.

167
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,129
You ladies go on ahead.

168
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,293
We gotta help Bill close his jeans.

169
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,559
All right, let's go.

170
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,745
All right, we have to find a nice boyfriend for Lou Ann.

171
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:46,592
Boy, that seems like a pile of work just to get your den back.

172
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:48,455
Well, it's not about my den.

173
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:51,040
It's about that poor girl living in my den.

174
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:52,903
So what's your type?

175
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,200
Uh, never mind about her type.

176
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,882
Just find a regular guy.

177
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:08,107
It's a scientific fact that women like round muscular butts.

178
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,630
I'm gonna look for a guy with a round muscular butt.

179
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,515
Uh, maybe we should split up.

180
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:17,176
Oh, one more thing.

181
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,998
Peggy doesn't know about this.

182
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh, you want me to tell her?

183
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:22,322
No, Bill.

184
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:23,824
Just dance with her.

185
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:25,185
Keep her busy.

186
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,585
What, me?

187
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:27,767
Dancing?

188
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,851
I don't know, I don't know.

189
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:43,275
My arms around a warm, okay.

190
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,038
Hmm.

191
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:48,685
Nah.

192
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:48,945
Hmm.

193
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:50,792
Possible.

194
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:52,914
Dale, I bought you a beer.

195
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,695
Mind if I dance with your wife?

196
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:55,516
Take her.

197
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,560
Sucker.

198
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,523
Y'all know, man, he ain't gonna have to worry about that.

199
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,725
If you go out and dance, she's gonna go Dutch, man.

200
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,087
Something to know of the way.

201
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,248
Well, you smell nice.

202
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,670
Dance with me, sugar?

203
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,831
Hey, boy, take what, man?

204
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:12,473
That ain't over CK1, man.

205
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:16,497
It's like catnip.

206
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,540
Hey, you seem like a regular guy.

207
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,618
Hi, what's Hank doing over there?

208
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,924
Well, I don't see him.

209
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:31,651
Bill, why are you spinning me into souvenir gold?

210
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,058
Been a while, I can't remember all the steps.

211
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,544
Well, just do what I say and we'll get along fine.

212
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:40,735
On three, brush, wrap and fan, lift and scoop, scrape and scoop.

213
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,572
What's your name, son?

214
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:49,613
Wade, sir.

215
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,675
That's some buckle you got there.

216
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,576
Thank you, sir.

217
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:57,683
It means a lot coming from a man like you who, I can plainly see, knows a thing or two about buckles.

218
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,007
Well, uh, well, this round's on me.

219
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,029
Fangeric by left.

220
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:03,810
Hitch right.

221
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,612
Fan fan, double dog down.

222
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:07,414
Hitch kick now, select that heel.

223
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,418
Heel toe, heel toe, heel toe, knee toe heel.

224
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:11,760
Quarterback, huh?

225
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,321
Varsity.

226
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:13,483
Love your mama?

227
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:14,364
You know I do.

228
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,768
She cook with a gas range?

229
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,228
Propane.

230
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,515
I don't know if I'm ready, Uncle Hank.

231
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,556
Sure you are.

232
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,399
And Wade's a catch-and-a-half.

233
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,863
He can run the 40 in under five seconds.

234
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:31,289
But my heart is telling me that... Your heart is telling you who's the boss.

235
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,712
You or your heart.

236
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:33,252
You are.

237
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,836
Your heart is your employee.

238
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,380
So get your heart off its butt and back to work.

239
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:40,026
You're right, Uncle Hank.

240
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,307
What am I waiting for?

241
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,590
Let's go get weighed.

242
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,355
Bill, you need to have more confidence in yourself.

243
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,458
If you ask Peggy Hill, you boot scoot with the best of them.

244
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:53,920
Well, I don't know.

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,023
All right, this next one's going to be ladies' choice.

246
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,887
Excuse me, Bill.

247
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:02,808
Hey, Peggy.

248
00:13:02,828 --> 00:13:04,009
Better than aerobics, huh?

249
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,931
You worked up quite a sweat.

250
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:07,793
That's not my sweat.

251
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,006
Where's Luan?

252
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,188
Luan's fine.

253
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,231
She's gonna get her eye at home with a friend.

254
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,334
Tush, push on three.

255
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:22,897
And three.

256
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,929
Is Luan gonna marry her new boyfriend?

257
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:35,576
Well, you never can tell, but my guess is, yeah.

258
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:35,856
Luan!

259
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,702
That's buckly.

260
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,405
Those better be for me.

261
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,288
No, they're for me for later.

262
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:42,590
Where's Luanne?

263
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:44,935
Luanne is out with her new boyfriend.

264
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:46,217
She's in love.

265
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:47,359
You blew it, Dip Head.

266
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,182
You can't compete with this new guy.

267
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:53,089
He's a football player, and football players know how to treat women right.

268
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,954
Now get off my lawn and don't come back.

269
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,195
Why'd you send Buckley away?

270
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:00,917
Luann wants him back.

271
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,099
Not gonna happen.

272
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,401
I found her a new guy.

273
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,303
You broke the rebound rule?

274
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,606
What has gotten into you, Hank?

275
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:11,031
Well, I was kind of hoping she might fall in love with Wade.

276
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,636
Well, hoping one hand and booing the other, see which one gets full first.

277
00:14:15,477 --> 00:14:16,999
Mm-mm, you are out of your depth, Hank Hill.

278
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,022
You've opened a Pandora's box.

279
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:22,569
A box that has a sign that reads, For Women Only.

280
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:31,767
As long as it took that river to carve the Grand Canyon, that is how long women have been learning to subtly manipulate relationships.

281
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:36,015
You only think it's easy because we make it look easy.

282
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:40,803
Did you really believe you could step in and fix it overnight?

283
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:43,588
Could you really be such a fool?

284
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:45,751
Who is you, Hank Hill?

285
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:46,312
Who is you?

286
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:47,093
No, no!

287
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,357
No, everything's gonna be fine.

288
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,100
Wade's a good guy.

289
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,881
You don't know.

290
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:53,063
He runs fast.

291
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,385
It'll be fine.

292
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:56,569
What's that?

293
00:14:58,979 --> 00:14:59,340
See?

294
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:00,603
Everything's fine.

295
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:02,467
Good ol' Wade drove her home.

296
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,954
Look at that, he's fixed his dodge up just like Boom Hours.

297
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:08,019
Well, why on earth would anyone do that?

298
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,863
Boom Hours?

299
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:12,749
Good night.

300
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,212
Thanks for the lift.

301
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,435
No!

302
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,216
Luanne, what happened to Wade?

303
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,858
Why aren't you with Wade?

304
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,340
I want Wade.

305
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,925
As soon as you left, Wade turned into Mr. Grabby Sam.

306
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:41,090
I think that you just fixed me up with him so you could get your den back.

307
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,193
Thank goodness, Boomhower gave me a lift.

308
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:43,874
A lift?

309
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,936
Is that what they're calling it these days?

310
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,019
You can't trust this guy.

311
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,364
He's a no-good, immoral, skirt-chasing rascal.

312
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:54,248
So, at least you like him better than Buckley.

313
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:55,290
What are you saying?

314
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,733
He's your new boyfriend?

315
00:15:56,793 --> 00:15:58,376
Hank, so what if he is?

316
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,259
If he is, he ain't no more.

317
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,983
Hank, you can't tell me what to do.

318
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,125
You're not my father.

319
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,089
Yeah, I guess not.

320
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,812
Damn straight I'm not.

321
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,878
But while you're under my roof, I'm your landlord.

322
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:13,003
And as your landlord, I forbid you to date Boomhauer.

323
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:13,885
Shut up, Hank.

324
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,949
I can find another roof.

325
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,391
I'll stay at Boom Howers!

326
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,152
Fine!

327
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:18,793
Fine!

328
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,257
Wait, man, I'll just stay there and go work out, man.

329
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:24,262
Those little girls come around here, they just flat-out know, man.

330
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:25,103
Thanks, Boom Howers.

331
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:25,704
Let's go.

332
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:28,589
Dang old women from Mars, man.

333
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:35,599
I'll tell you what.

334
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,022
Don't go in there, Lou Ann.

335
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,023
I'm warning you.

336
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:39,305
You'll be sorry.

337
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:43,692
Damn it, this neighborhood is turning into Melrose Place.

338
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:57,772
Hank, it is after midnight.

339
00:16:57,812 --> 00:16:59,055
What the heck are you doing?

340
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,641
Clearing some space from a leaf blower.

341
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:03,064
Mm-hmm.

342
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,011
Now, Hank, this is not about the leaf blower, is it?

343
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:07,013
Sure it is.

344
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:13,066
What are you eating?

345
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:13,706
Nothing.

346
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,708
You are eating your emotions, aren't you?

347
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:16,689
Maybe who knows?

348
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:17,190
I don't know.

349
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,211
I don't care, whatever.

350
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:24,356
You thought you could fix Lou Ann like a flywheel drive plate, but a flywheel drive plate doesn't talk back.

351
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:27,119
Flywheel drive plates do not have feelings.

352
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,221
Flywheel drive plates... I took her in, Peg.

353
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,465
I put a 20-year roof over her head and a sofa sleeper under the rest of her.

354
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,266
And this is the thanks I get?

355
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:39,210
Well, no thanks.

356
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:40,745
Just face it, Hank Hill.

357
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:44,850
The only reason you're this upset is because you care so much about Luanne.

358
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,414
The only thing I care about is getting my den back.

359
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,384
Boy, I've never been in here before.

360
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,406
Oh, it sure is bachelor-y.

361
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,830
Can I turn this light on?

362
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:02,575
Oh, uh, that's real pretty.

363
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,237
Uh, gosh.

364
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,662
Oh, you move very fast, boomhauer.

365
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:18,614
I'm having all these feelings and I need just a little time to... Okay, last case of beer.

366
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:19,677
Let's divvy it up.

367
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:24,127
Hey, it don't split up even anymore.

368
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:25,910
That one's Boom Howard's.

369
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,614
That cradle robber's getting none of my beer.

370
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,416
Boom Howard didn't do anything.

371
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,379
And even if he did, why do you care?

372
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:34,061
Lu Ann's not your relation.

373
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,465
Hell, she's my wife's brother's daughter.

374
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:38,388
You can't get any closer than that.

375
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,192
Look, let's just split that six pack up.

376
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:42,273
We can each take two.

377
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,940
Tell you what, why don't I just take the whole thing?

378
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,661
Okay, Mom.

379
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,984
Let's try and move a mile.

380
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,791
and split kick right and back and split kick left and sideways shuffle go!

381
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:00,758
Oh, are you okay, Bobby?

382
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:01,380
Yeah.

383
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:04,585
Well, it was a nice move.

384
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,649
Yeah.

385
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:06,869
Aw, honey.

386
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,414
It's just not right without Luan.

387
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:10,015
Yeah.

388
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,328
This was a nice idea, Pig.

389
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:17,810
Get us out of that house.

390
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:22,797
Son, they got eight kinds of ketchup here, and three kinds of ketchup.

391
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,646
Not that I'm going to have some of that fried chicken, fried plate, fried chicken, fried side, fried, fried okra.

392
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,409
Luan!

393
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,031
And boomhauer too.

394
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:34,014
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?

395
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,740
Uh, is that gravy lumpy tonight?

396
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,964
Hey, I'm Peggy, Uncle Hank.

397
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:44,273
I'll take a bowl of the white gravy and a bowl of brown gravy.

398
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:48,022
Hey, Dad, it's Luann, right behind you.

399
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,585
Dad, it's Luann.

400
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:51,850
Hey, Dad, can't you hear me?

401
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,075
Luann, right behind you.

402
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:01,410
Say, Hank, man, I don't know what you're thinking, man, but y'all got no man.

403
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,054
I ain't no dang old Woody Allen with that little soon lead, man.

404
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:05,236
This ain't nothing going to happen.

405
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,381
Boom, Hauer, you're not going to talk your way out of this one.

406
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:09,483
Uncle Hank?

407
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,327
Don't uncle me anymore, Lou Ann.

408
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,152
Just come on by tomorrow and pick your stuff up.

409
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,676
I got it all boxed and ready to go.

410
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,743
Well, you finally got your wish.

411
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,406
You are going to get your den back.

412
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:25,648
I hope you're happy.

413
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:30,805
Look at she's crying again.

414
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:34,829
I guess she just got dumped by her new boyfriend, Boomhauer.

415
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,252
Boomhauer didn't dump her.

416
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:37,693
You did.

417
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:38,234
What?

418
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:38,794
What was that?

419
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:41,257
She said Boomhauer didn't dump her.

420
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:41,898
You did.

421
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,061
Pass the kids up.

422
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,712
I came for my stuff.

423
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:54,994
That's all in there.

424
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:17,139
I was moving stuff around and it seems that the room looks a little better this way.

425
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:20,623
The bed is keeping out.

426
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:24,627
Well, I figure there's no sense in packing it up night after night.

427
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,777
Love you, Uncle Hank.

428
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:31,623
Oh, Lord.

429
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,073
See, still looking?

430
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:44,737
Yep.

431
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,941
You know, Hank, maybe it's time to settle this.

432
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:52,386
Yeah, I just hate these big emotional scenes.

433
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,875
Well, let's get it over with.

434
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:56,679
Boom hour!

435
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,660
Yep.

436
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:58,762
Beer?

437
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:01,487
Yep.

438
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:09,261
That was beautiful.
