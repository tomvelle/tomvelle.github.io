Morning, Dale.
Hi, John Redcorn.
Uh, Bill.
Morning, John Redcorn.
Oh, Peggy.
Just dropping off a new healing herb for Nancy to help with her migraines.
Kinko biloba.
Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Sure, I've heard of that.
Well, you must be reading Doyle Harkavy.
What's he got for us this morning?
When it comes to starting the day, nothing wakes me up faster than coffee.
Boy, he's got that right.
They say children are a blessing, but mine are holy terrors.
Oh, Doyle Harkavy knows children.
Of course, his daughter jumped out a window.
I don't believe it.
Doyle Harkavy is retiring from the musings column.
No!
He's going to write product descriptions for Bradley, air, and heat.
I don't know how they'll ever replace him.
I know how.
You could write that column at Peggy.
You're a natural.
Now, Luanne, Peggy has a musing now and then, but Doyle Harkavy is a musing machine.
Well, I think I could do it as well as anyone else could.
I play boggle, and that takes verbal ability.
And I'm always making observations all day long.
Really?
Go ahead.
Come up with one.
You mean right now?
Okay.
All right.
Well, let's see.
I like milk.
Hey, that's the best so far.
Do you want about cookies?
No.
Stupid.
Too obvious.
Why don't you try some out on me?
Give me your five best.
I cannot work with you coming in here every two hours and yelling at me.
I'm going to Nancy's.
Nancy?
Nancy?
Hello?
Where are you?
Nancy?
Nancy?
Oh, there you are.
Hello, John Redcorn.
Yes, we were just back here.
Oh, I just had to get out of that house.
I am trying to do some creative work and Hank seems to think that he's helping by making me more and more stressed out.
It has given me a whopping headache.
Yes, headaches can often be caused by stress.
Of course, John Redcorn, you're a licensed New Age healer.
Why don't I try a healing session with you?
Well, I guess that would be all right.
It is my job.
Oh, that'd be great.
Okay, I'll call you for an appointment.
That was awkward.
What kind of game is she playing?
Well, Shug, I don't think she knows about us.
Peggy's got such a trust in nature.
She always believes the best in people.
You know, all of a sudden I feel dirty.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'll join you.
Hmm.
Hmm.
The whales sing of joy and sorrow, of gain and loss, like Leanne Rimes.
Ah, there.
Now lie quietly for as long as you want, while I copy both sides of your insurance card.
Yo, Peggy's gonna have a hard time replacing Doyle Harcavy.
That guy's amazing.
I mean, you look at his picture in the paper, he never gets a day older.
Well, she has to mail in a sample column this week.
But she'll muse circles around him if she can just get past her headaches.
Well, those headaches are good as gone.
Peggy went to John Redcorn for a healing.
What?
Don't worry.
Old John R. will fix her up just like he does for Nancy, three times a week.
Oh, Hank, I'm sure Peggy's headache is nowhere near as serious as Nancy's.
Oh, man, I tell you what, man, you don't want to know.
I can't even have one of these with you.
Don't worry about Peggy.
She does not have the same kind of medical condition that's causing Dale's wife to suffer unduly.
Where is she?
Everything is beautiful in its own way.
Like this- Oh, I hank.
Uh, hey Peggy, I guess dinner's gonna be a little late tonight, huh?
Oh, yep.
I just had a headache session with John Redcorn.
He lit some sweet grass and then I drifted off.
The next thing I knew, I felt fan-free-contastic.
Well good, your headache's gone, and I guess you're all done with John freaking Redcorn.
Oh no, this is just the beginning.
I have already scheduled another treatment for next week.
Peggy, I don't know how some guy rubbing your neck helps your head.
I mean, what's the connection?
Ooh, my reporter's instincts tell me someone's a little grumpy without his dinner.
I?
I just got my first musing.
My husband calls me his better half because I better have dinner on the table when he gets home.
I'm gonna go write that up while it's still fresh.
What's wrong, Uncle Hank?
Nothing's wrong.
It's good news.
Peggy Hatterhead ain't cured by John Redcorn.
Stop that!
Put your face back the way it was before somebody sees you.
What's wrong, New Ann?
Nothing's wrong, Bobby.
Now go play outside.
Dinner's gonna be a little late.
Hank, would you like a beer?
This is not a social call, John Redcorn.
I think I know why you're here.
Your wife came to me with a headache.
A real headache.
Her head actually hurt.
I know that, but as I recall, that's how it started with Nancy Gribble.
Hank, you are my friend.
I promise you, I would never heal your wife in the way that I heal the wives of others.
You better not, because if you lay one unprofessional hand on Peggy, I'm gonna kick your ass.
I will.
Oh, my Lord!
Oh, Hank, I got it.
They are giving me the musings column.
Oh, thank God.
You got the job, the pressure's off, no more headaches, right?
Aren't you kidding?
I have weekly deadlines now.
I'm gonna have to schedule a regular night with John Redcorn.
What?
No, you don't need John Redcorn to get rid of a headache.
Here, I'll give you a massage.
Just let me know where you really need it.
That's my kidneys.
Breathe.
Picture a wide open field.
Throw some birds in there if you want.
Hank, stop it.
You're just pinching and slapping and poking me.
What is it that you have against John Redcorn?
Don't make me say it.
You know what he does to his clients?
You think he's overcharging me?
Well, for your information, I checked around.
He is less expensive than both VIP and Oriental Massage.
For God's sakes, Peggy, come on.
It's taken him 13 years to cure Nancy's headache.
So you're saying he... What are you... You're calling him a quack?
You're saying his methods aren't effective?
No, I'm saying they're very effective.
Come on, you know what I'm talking about.
Nancy, John Redcorn, Joseph...
Good God.
I just cannot believe that I could be so stupid.
How could you not tell me what was going on in my own side yard?
I thought you knew.
How could you not know?
I mean, look at Joseph.
Where do you think he came from?
Nancy told me Dale had a Jamaican grandmother.
Oh, I believed her.
Oh my God, Dale.
Does Dale know?
No, no.
He's as slow as you.
Huh?
In a sweet, trusting sort of way.
Shameless tramp.
How can she?
I just cannot believe.
You dirty bird.
What's wrong, Sherk?
Joseph is not Jamaican, and neither is Dale, and I am beginning to suspect that his grandmother isn't either.
So you know.
Who told you?
No one had to tell me.
How stupid do you think I am?
You've been cheating for 12 years.
Nancy, how could you?
I have my reasons.
Yes, and I've seen those reasons packed into his Sergio Valente jeans.
I bet you don't even have headaches anymore.
Man, you!
Dale Gribble is your friend.
How could you be a look the other way?
Now, Peggy, you're sort of freaked out because it's still fresh for you.
Live with it a while.
You'll see you'll get used to it.
The only thing I ever want to get used to is a cold glass lemonade.
I am still a journalist, darn it.
Did anyone else sniff today's garbage?
And I thought yesterday's garbage smelled good.
Morning, Dale.
You poor poor man.
Hi, John Redcorn.
Uh, Bill?
Well, well, well.
Jahan Redcorn.
Oh, Piggy.
Nancy's headache's very severe this morning.
Must be the pollen.
Well, well, well.
Well.
Jahan Redcorn.
Piggy Hill.
Piggy Hill, what's so important I have to jump off treadmill?
Oh, I'm so sorry, men, but I had to talk to someone.
It's about Nancy.
She's having an affair.
Oh my god!
She's cheating on John Redcorn?
You know about them?
Oh, not at first.
It took me about an hour.
But I'm naive and trusting person.
Piggy here, you not know?
What?
I knew.
Piggy here not know?
That is so funny!
Okay, who I tell?
Who I tell?
Oh, I email Khan.
Why are we drinking beer in front of my house?
We always drink beer in the back of my house.
This feels wrong.
But I like it.
Dale will never find us here, and we need to talk alone.
Does it bother anyone that we've known for years what's going on with Nancy and Dale doesn't?
Nancy is having an affair with John Redcorn?
This is the first I've heard of it.
I am shocked.
I mean, I am shocked.
That's what I mean.
I am appalled.
Yeah, man, you don't want to be prying on my family secrets.
I ain't, man.
You don't get a little scared and don't close it, man.
It's like having an old Redenbacher, man.
It turns out it's just a dang old actor.
Look, can't we just discuss it for five seconds?
I don't believe it.
I've known Dale and Nancy for years, and they have a fair book marriage.
Ah, shut up, Bill.
What, Dale?
How nice to see you.
I can't find Hank, Bill, or Boomhower.
If they're hiding behind the door, just nod slowly.
Oh, you sweet man.
You know, I have been thinking a lot about you.
We never get to talk you and I. Why is that?
Anyway, Nancy should count herself lucky to have a man like you.
Just look at you, the way that hat accents your head.
Plenty of women would be happy to have you.
Good, good women.
Would you like to come in for some pie?
I should go.
Hey Dale, what's going on?
Oh, not much.
Peggy Hill wants to leave Hank and run away with me.
I don't believe it.
We'll have a fairy book marriage.
Let's face it, Angie Dickinson has lost her looks.
Mix pineapple juice with club soda.
You got yourself a big bucket of crap.
Well, go ahead, say it.
They're terrible.
How am I supposed to appreciate the little things in life when so many big things are wrong and evil?
Oh, don't worry, Aunt Peggy.
I'm sure that even Doyle Harkavy had trouble sometimes.
Doyle Harkavy.
Doyle Harkavy.
If you ask me, Doyle Harkavy wasn't that good.
Thank you, Mom.
It's about time somebody said it.
Of course coffee wakes you up in the morning.
I mean, that's how they advertise it.
You'll see.
Being with the Gribbles when you know about Nancy is weird at first, but it goes away after a few years.
It helps if you think of something else.
I use sports.
You can use boggle.
All right, you guys are just in time.
Boom hour's on second.
Nancy's healer's at bat.
Oh man, look at that John Redcorn.
He sure can swing.
Woo!
Good eye.
Are you kidding?
This guy never strikes out.
Ain't that right, Nancy?
Oh, boggle, boggle, boggle, think, boggle.
All right, window, man.
Red corn's gonna score again.
Score, score, score, score, score, score, soar, soar, soar, soar.
All right, come on, John, come on, he's going all the way.
I have to get out of here.
Ballpark nachos.
You don't buy them, you only rent them.
I'm done, Hank.
My rose-colored glasses are off, and the world looks flesh-colored and unappealing.
I cannot live the lie anymore.
Well, it takes two to talk about it, and everyone else already knows and isn't interested.
Mm-mm.
No, not everybody knows, Hank.
I can think of one person who doesn't, the one person who really should.
Well, all right, way to go, big bad John.
Hold up, Peggy.
You can't just walk back over there and tell Dale his wife's cheating on him.
Just let sleeping dogs lie.
Oh, interesting choice of words, Mr. Hill.
Lie.
I meant lie down.
I know that, Hank.
Dogs don't tell lies.
Only people lie.
They lie like dogs.
Hmm.
Hank, there's something I just figured out and you need to know.
Uh, sorry, I can't hear you.
Probably none of my business anyway.
Sander.
Hank, it's important.
Your wife loves me and wants us to run off together.
I've not yet been able to ascertain where.
Dale.
No problemo on this end.
I don't even find her attractive.
Of course you do, and I appreciate the lie, but Peggy's just being nice to you.
But you're a good friend for wanting to tell me.
Dale, if the shoe were on the other foot, would you want to know?
Don't flatter yourself, Hank.
Nancy likes her men thin and pale of face.
I thank God every day for sending me an angel with the hots for my track team physique.
You hear the expression, lie like a dog, often enough that it is almost a cliche.
But more often than not, if someone is lying to you, they're a person.
We all know a certain person who is lying to her husband.
Every time we look the other way, we add a lie to a lie.
Well, this reporter is not going to lie anymore.
And you can print that.
Excuse me?
Shug, listen.
I love Dale, but in a light's own sort of way.
Well, I feel for you.
I really do.
But you married for better or worse, and worse includes Dale.
Now, either you tell him or I will.
Peggy, please.
I'm not going to.
Well, then get out of my way.
Hey Dale, I thought I'd like to take a little of my own advice this morning.
Having some waffles, are ya?
No, I meant the longer one, about sleeping dogs.
Dale, I have to tell you something very important.
Oh, no.
Dale, Nancy is not the wife you think she is.
And, and John Redcorn?
Well, he is not the friend that you think he is.
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
Nancy and John Redcorn did something to your dog?
No, damn it, Dale.
Nancy and John Redcorn are- Hey, Dad!
Just a sec, Peggy.
Yes, son?
Me and Bobby are bored.
What do we do?
How about renting a video take?
Yeah, well, we want to see Encino Man, but we don't have any money.
Paulie Shore 1992 Colossic.
Well, I got two fives.
One for you, one for me.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, wait.
I found some more.
Can't watch Encino Man without milk balls, huh?
Thanks, Dad.
I'm sorry about that, Peggy.
Now, what is it that I don't know?
Dale.
Uh... I just found out that... Vikings were the first visitors to the moon.
Well, I knew that.
Why do you think we named our spacecraft after them?
Poor naive Peggy.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
I'm so glad you and I could have this little talk.
I feel so much better.
Okay, I guess.
Peggy.
Huh?
You've got a good husband there.
He doesn't have the best body on the alley, but he's got a good head on his shoulders.
Yeah, I know.
Well, how'd he take it?
I couldn't tell him.
I guess some things are best left unsaid.
Yep.
You know, Hank, I really... I know, and Piggy... I gotcha.
Alright then.
Great!
Pepperoni it is!
Pehegi Hill.
