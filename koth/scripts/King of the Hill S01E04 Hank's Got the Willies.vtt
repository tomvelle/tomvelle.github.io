WEBVTT

00:01.364 --> 00:18.489
Why do you say we tee off together, Hank?

00:18.509 --> 00:22.455
Sure thing, Willie.

00:28.063 --> 00:29.546
Dead solid perfect!

00:29.666 --> 00:30.527
Ha ha!

00:38.810 --> 00:42.682
You know, Hank, I've always wanted to sell propane and propane accessories like you do.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.129
I guess this dang music thing came up.

00:46.293 --> 00:48.078
Well, there ain't no change in the past, I guess.

00:48.159 --> 00:48.921
Let's jam.

01:03.869 --> 01:09.846
What in the name of dad?

01:12.353 --> 01:12.914
Bobby!

01:14.198 --> 01:14.318
Uh-oh.

01:44.808 --> 01:46.651
Son, have you lost your mind?

01:46.691 --> 01:48.493
Aren't you supposed to knock first?

01:48.613 --> 01:49.715
I could have been naked.

01:49.895 --> 01:51.798
Bobby, how many times have I told you?

01:52.218 --> 01:54.041
Betsy is not a toy.

01:54.401 --> 02:00.750
She's a 1963 Guild Solid Top... What's that smell?

02:01.150 --> 02:02.873
You been playing this with your feet?

02:03.153 --> 02:04.555
That's cheese, Dad.

02:05.648 --> 02:08.776
Why would there ever be cheese on Betsy?

02:09.257 --> 02:10.039
It's funny.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.442
It's a comedy routine.

02:11.783 --> 02:15.673
You know, you play the guitar with a piece of cheese and you go, hey, look at me.

02:15.953 --> 02:17.658
I'm Eddie Cheddar.

02:19.502 --> 02:21.126
You know it's from Celeryhead.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.211
What is a celery head?

02:23.491 --> 02:25.334
He's the world's best comedian.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.415
He glues things.

02:26.876 --> 02:33.946
Like he glues a clean Xbox to a tennis shoe and goes, this is in case you have a runny nose.

02:33.966 --> 02:35.448
That's not a joke, son.

02:35.728 --> 02:37.331
That's a waste of good glue.

02:37.851 --> 02:40.415
Well, he makes $3 million a year.

02:40.755 --> 02:42.077
You must have got that wrong.

02:42.558 --> 02:45.262
People don't pay money to see things like that.

02:45.883 --> 02:48.987
Now, Robert Klein, that's something you pay money for.

02:50.097 --> 02:51.339
What is going on in there?

02:51.399 --> 02:53.562
Thank you, I'm worried about our boy.

02:53.842 --> 02:57.748
Some green-haired freak told him to rub cheese on my guitar.

02:58.489 --> 02:59.851
Oh, you mean celery head.

03:00.312 --> 03:01.994
I saw him on entertainment tonight.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.518
He makes three million dollars a year.

03:06.902 --> 03:09.666
Luan, good lord, put on some pants.

03:09.986 --> 03:10.948
I'm wearing shorts.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.012
Don't scare me like that.

03:16.186 --> 03:18.729
Look at this, Peggy, the boy chipped Betsy's bridge.

03:19.409 --> 03:22.633
And he woke me up from my Willie Nelson golfing dream number three.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.756
I, calm down, it is just a bunch of wood and some wires.

03:26.056 --> 03:26.877
Wood and wires?

03:27.638 --> 03:29.540
I've had Betsy since high school.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.081
I took her to the prom.

03:31.762 --> 03:33.123
I love this guitar.

03:33.584 --> 03:34.925
Do you understand what I'm saying?

03:34.945 --> 03:37.288
Do you understand what love means?

03:37.308 --> 03:39.270
Yes, I love my family.

03:39.530 --> 03:40.491
Yeah, now you're getting it.

03:40.831 --> 03:43.594
That's the kind of love I have for Betsy.

03:43.810 --> 03:46.132
I'm going back to sleep, you coming?

03:46.753 --> 03:47.333
I'm already up.

03:47.974 --> 03:50.476
Besides, I wouldn't want to make Betsy jealous.

03:51.217 --> 03:54.020
Luanne, would you please not sit like that?

03:54.040 --> 04:00.946
I sell propane and propane accessories, I tell you what.

04:01.386 --> 04:02.587
Shut up, Dale!

04:08.173 --> 04:09.033
Oh, Willie, no!

04:09.254 --> 04:10.695
That's a one-way street!

04:11.890 --> 04:14.593
Right, Bobby.

04:14.613 --> 04:15.133
What happened to my truck?

04:15.153 --> 04:15.514
Your mower hit it.

04:15.534 --> 04:19.538
Well, maybe I ought to send my mower to one of those children psychologists.

04:22.321 --> 04:23.943
Are you mad about something, Aunt Peggy?

04:24.403 --> 04:24.763
Mad.

04:25.184 --> 04:26.065
Why would I be mad?

04:26.085 --> 04:29.609
Just because Hank pays more attention to that silly guitar than he does to me.

04:32.512 --> 04:33.993
Lay off the gas, Aunt Peggy.

04:34.033 --> 04:36.476
If I break another nail, I'll fail my manicure final.

04:36.816 --> 04:38.598
Are you having trouble at the beauty academy, Louie?

04:39.259 --> 04:39.619
No.

04:40.730 --> 04:43.153
I'm also failing braid work.

04:43.173 --> 04:45.936
Braid work does not come natural to the women in our family, honey.

04:46.617 --> 04:49.861
You know it, I know it, and the whole town knows it.

04:49.881 --> 04:51.884
Sounds like your whore's going off.

04:52.284 --> 04:54.026
You really think so, Bill?

04:55.228 --> 04:55.448
Oh, yeah.

04:56.249 --> 04:57.070
Damn it, Hank.

04:57.110 --> 05:00.895
You know I can't have loud, sudden noises while I'm meditating.

05:01.355 --> 05:04.499
I was a nose hair away from attaining inner peace.

05:07.363 --> 05:09.285
Don't even try to take credit for that.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.282
It was not done by me.

05:11.863 --> 05:13.466
It was done through me.

05:15.509 --> 05:17.311
What is that chinging noise?

05:18.313 --> 05:22.799
One of those stealth helicopters with computerized noise cancellation capability.

05:24.562 --> 05:26.064
They're still working the chings out.

05:26.445 --> 05:28.788
How'd you know about stealth helicopters?

05:28.808 --> 05:32.033
Alt dot conspiracy dot black dot helicopters.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.398
Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, that dang old internet, man.

05:34.418 --> 05:40.261
You just go on there and point and click, get in there and talk about www.duby.com and you got that naked chicks on there, man.

05:40.281 --> 05:42.008
You just go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

05:42.029 --> 05:43.153
It's real easy, man.

05:46.475 --> 05:47.897
Bobby, give me that club!

05:48.539 --> 05:50.762
Son, maybe I'm not getting through to you.

05:51.183 --> 05:52.004
Let me explain.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.010
You gotta respect other people's things.

05:55.571 --> 05:59.397
You do not use a man's pitching wedge to hit clumps of mud.

05:59.718 --> 06:01.060
It's not mud, dad.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.342
It's dog dew.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.347
Boy ain't right.

06:06.169 --> 06:07.230
Oh yeah!

06:07.251 --> 06:07.932
Excellent workout.

06:08.052 --> 06:09.534
I got my rotator cuff rotating.

06:09.755 --> 06:11.638
My face feels weird.

06:12.530 --> 06:13.171
Carlos!

06:13.652 --> 06:14.253
Carlos?

06:14.633 --> 06:16.276
You name your things, I'll name mine.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.419
Well, what about that thing named Bobby?

06:18.739 --> 06:19.981
What are we going to do about him?

06:20.522 --> 06:23.506
He seems bent on destroying everything I own.

06:23.887 --> 06:26.511
Why can't he turn that energy into something useful?

06:27.031 --> 06:30.356
Like that boy with no legs who ran across Canada.

06:30.496 --> 06:34.182
Maybe you need to spend some time together, you know, just talking you and Bobby.

06:34.542 --> 06:35.764
Mano a mano.

06:36.005 --> 06:38.368
Well, I can't now, I'm going golfing.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.568
Peg, we're riding to full 18 holes today.

06:42.089 --> 06:44.452
You know what that kind of stress can do to a boy?

06:46.996 --> 06:52.243
Bobby, I apologize for yelling at you, but sometimes you just don't listen.

06:52.923 --> 06:56.168
It's like you got a problem with concentration.

06:58.090 --> 06:58.411
Bobby?

06:59.412 --> 06:59.773
Bobby?

07:00.654 --> 07:01.555
Bobby!

07:02.277 --> 07:03.139
Hey!

07:03.159 --> 07:04.481
You just killed me!

07:04.501 --> 07:05.703
Well, you needed killing.

07:06.385 --> 07:10.893
You know, I've been thinking, son, and I realized you don't have any goals.

07:11.594 --> 07:14.660
You gotta figure out what you wanna do with your life.

07:15.181 --> 07:17.265
Okay, can we go to Six Flags?

07:18.848 --> 07:20.870
I think you need a role model, Bobby.

07:21.471 --> 07:23.674
Someone to emulate, a hero.

07:24.315 --> 07:27.659
Someone besides that broccoli neck.

07:27.679 --> 07:29.661
How about Eddie Stilson?

07:29.681 --> 07:31.383
Can I emulate him?

07:31.403 --> 07:33.346
Now there you go, Eddie Stilson.

07:33.967 --> 07:37.891
Which one's he, the space shuttle astronaut or the stock car champ?

07:38.092 --> 07:40.755
He got to the end of level six and screamed ninja.

07:41.022 --> 07:45.807
Bobby, when I say hero, I don't mean some weird Game Boy freak.

07:46.348 --> 07:49.371
If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.

07:50.952 --> 07:52.354
Deal me out this hand, Jason.

07:53.495 --> 07:54.516
I'm about to bust.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.659
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.600
Oh, good lord!

08:01.483 --> 08:02.785
You know Howard Adderley?

08:03.245 --> 08:05.848
He's my number two hero after Eddie Stilson.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.573
Bobby, you need to be lectured all afternoon.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.497
Peggy, I'm taking the boy golfing, and that's that.

08:20.766 --> 08:21.707
Careful now, Peggy.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.349
Betsy isn't strapped in yet.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.933
Oh, do not tell me you are taking that thing golfing with you now.

08:27.194 --> 08:28.355
Don't be silly, Peg.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.397
Just bring her in to get fixed.

08:31.018 --> 08:31.879
Sit in the middle, son.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.143
I want to make sure Betsy's in front of the airbag.

08:36.288 --> 08:38.731
So Bobby, we gotta think of a hero for you.

08:39.171 --> 08:41.154
Do you have a hero, Dad?

08:41.174 --> 08:43.376
I sure do, and it's Willie Nelson.

08:43.837 --> 08:44.377
How cool.

08:44.878 --> 08:48.042
Well, you might say he's been my inspiration.

08:48.843 --> 08:52.687
See, Willie grew up in Texas, and I grew up in Texas.

08:52.707 --> 08:54.790
He loves golfing and playing guitar.

08:55.470 --> 08:57.152
I love golfing and playing guitar.

08:57.753 --> 09:05.502
He's had trouble with the IRS, and I must have spent six hours last April on that 1040 form.

09:05.633 --> 09:06.998
Easy, my ass.

09:07.841 --> 09:09.346
Do you have a hero like that?

09:10.671 --> 09:12.758
Uh, Willie Nelson?

09:14.020 --> 09:17.786
You're just saying Willie Nelson because I said Willie Nelson.

09:18.006 --> 09:19.769
No, I like Willie Nelson.

09:20.089 --> 09:21.071
He's got long hair.

09:21.471 --> 09:22.773
He's alternative.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.035
Now you take that back.

09:24.616 --> 09:32.268
I followed that man from country western to country to adult contemporary and that's as far as I'm going.

09:32.288 --> 09:34.111
Here son, take a look at that.

09:34.752 --> 09:38.357
That's Willie Nelson's own personal golf course.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.645
I am going to show that brain machine who's boss, Aunt Peggy.

09:44.925 --> 09:45.667
Go on the wind.

09:45.947 --> 09:47.990
Show this town there's a braider in the family.

09:50.474 --> 09:51.395
I'm not scared of you.

09:51.575 --> 09:53.378
This time I'm going to beat you at your own game.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.792
Miss Cramsire!

10:05.978 --> 10:07.240
It's the bridge, isn't it?

10:07.801 --> 10:09.224
Well, bridge is the symptom.

10:09.665 --> 10:11.328
Frat asymmetry is the disease.

10:11.388 --> 10:15.556
Smells like a belly button.

10:15.856 --> 10:18.281
Yeah, my son was playing it with a piece of cheese.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.545
You mean like celery head?

10:21.470 --> 10:23.653
Look, I'm Camembert Humperdinger.

10:23.933 --> 10:27.918
Les, go in the back and alphabetize the guitar strings.

10:27.938 --> 10:30.362
Now alphabetize by letter or... Les.

10:30.582 --> 10:31.343
Okay.

10:31.683 --> 10:32.404
All right.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.747
Geez or not, this is a sweet, sweet guitar.

10:35.448 --> 10:36.189
Is she for sale?

10:36.490 --> 10:37.071
Not hardly.

10:37.451 --> 10:38.653
Just fix the bridge, Earl.

10:39.434 --> 10:40.315
Oh, I didn't think so.

10:40.875 --> 10:45.081
Most guys would sell their wives before they'd sell a guitar like this.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.383
I gotta remember that one.

10:48.445 --> 10:49.966
Oh, heck, I got a million of them.

10:49.986 --> 10:52.068
Like, women are a lot like a guitar.

10:52.248 --> 10:53.790
They both come with strings attached.

10:57.894 --> 11:00.217
Oh, actually, I guess those are the only two.

11:00.657 --> 11:02.699
Most women will be threatened by Betsy, but not me.

11:02.739 --> 11:03.160
I don't care.

11:04.401 --> 11:08.505
And I would like to see that guitar come home and chicken fry a steak after substitute teaching all day.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.408
Ow.

11:11.428 --> 11:13.110
Well, thank you, Mrs. Hellman.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.489
Santa Claus!

11:20.849 --> 11:21.890
What are you talking about?

11:22.171 --> 11:23.112
Santa Claus!

11:23.152 --> 11:26.176
He could be the boy's hero in one twenty-four hour period.

11:26.196 --> 11:28.759
He delivers toys and enjoyed every child on earth.

11:29.119 --> 11:30.822
Santa Claus is for babies.

11:31.582 --> 11:33.204
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

11:39.212 --> 11:41.595
Damn Russian titanium, my lord.

11:56.695 --> 11:57.776
Huh.

11:57.796 --> 12:00.199
Maybe it's just first-hold jitters.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.361
Got any tips, boomhauer?

12:01.741 --> 12:02.102
Yeah, man.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.163
I'll tell you what you do, man.

12:03.183 --> 12:04.985
You just gotta keep that thing of warm straight, man.

12:05.005 --> 12:06.707
Y'all put your left hand still, man.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.289
Just speed it the hell up.

12:08.550 --> 12:09.210
Let's roll.

12:09.671 --> 12:10.372
Come on, Bobby.

12:15.238 --> 12:15.899
Oh, man.

12:16.299 --> 12:17.421
I'm out of cigarettes.

12:18.162 --> 12:19.243
This ain't gonna get yoked.

12:19.263 --> 12:20.965
It has to... four.

12:21.603 --> 12:24.147
Mr. Gribble, who's your all-time hero?

12:24.468 --> 12:26.411
You are, if you get me some smokes.

12:27.292 --> 12:31.139
So the stripper says to the priest... Build the boy.

12:32.861 --> 12:38.791
She says I decided to repent and become a nun.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.155
And I owe a nun.

12:42.016 --> 12:44.220
That's pretty funny.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.842
Hey, Dad, watch this.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.425
No, no, son, don't.

12:49.598 --> 12:50.880
All right, Bobby.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.402
Well, I'll be.

12:53.243 --> 12:57.911
Son, you just might be the next Lee Trevino without the crazy accent.

12:58.572 --> 13:01.075
Tell you what, I'm going to let you tee off on this hole.

13:01.516 --> 13:01.977
Okay.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.502
That's okay, Bobby.

13:05.562 --> 13:06.143
You can do it.

13:06.303 --> 13:10.189
Just choke up on it and swing less like a girl.

13:14.658 --> 13:16.740
I get a do-over.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.662
Bobby, hop in.

13:19.042 --> 13:21.044
Hank, dispose of the witnesses.

13:21.905 --> 13:23.187
Dale, come back here.

13:23.247 --> 13:27.691
Willie Nelson.

13:28.992 --> 13:30.834
Check his pockets for cigarettes.

13:33.877 --> 13:36.780
Willie Nelson, oh my lord, are you okay?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.282
Am I bleeding from the ears?

13:38.622 --> 13:38.922
No.

13:40.224 --> 13:41.745
Then I must be okay then.

13:42.485 --> 13:45.468
Oh, Mr. Nelson, I am so sorry.

13:46.109 --> 13:50.214
My boy is new to golf and oh gosh, I'm your biggest fan.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.036
I go to every concert I can.

13:52.376 --> 13:54.578
I've been to every farm aid except one.

13:55.139 --> 13:57.362
I don't much care for that Brian Adams.

13:57.682 --> 14:00.745
Damn, I wish I had my guitar here with me for you to sign.

14:00.785 --> 14:07.092
Here, why don't you make it out to, let's say, to my best friend.

14:07.453 --> 14:12.238
No, no, I don't want you to lie to my good friend.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.401
Hmm.

14:13.421 --> 14:16.146
To my number one fan, Hank Hill.

14:17.249 --> 14:18.451
Uh, hey, hey, Willie.

14:18.471 --> 14:19.995
You know, I play guitar too.

14:20.836 --> 14:24.484
I also play golf, but you already know that.

14:24.504 --> 14:28.493
But you probably don't know you're, uh, you're my hero.

14:29.094 --> 14:30.497
He took our cart.

14:30.713 --> 14:31.895
Was he bleeding from the ears?

14:32.436 --> 14:32.676
No.

14:33.217 --> 14:34.239
Well, he must be okay then.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.001
You don't understand, Peg.

14:36.502 --> 14:40.108
A man only gets a chance to meet Willie Nelson once in his life.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.131
It's supposed to be special.

14:42.812 --> 14:46.718
We meet on the golf course, he compliments my perfect swing.

14:47.339 --> 14:53.369
We start talking about music, cut an album, go on tour, open a chicken franchise.

14:54.270 --> 14:55.692
How's that gonna happen now?

14:56.473 --> 14:58.797
It's my fault forever, taking the boy with me.

14:59.603 --> 15:01.026
I said I was sorry.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.512
Um, are you Hank Hill?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.597
Uh, yes.

15:07.261 --> 15:08.945
I'm tired of being lack of focus.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.930
I'm gonna show them I can do better.

15:11.391 --> 15:12.874
I'm gonna make my dad proud.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.545
I'm gonna not tell dad about that.

15:41.791 --> 15:44.014
Hey, is that Ben Crenshaw Turbo Golf?

15:44.415 --> 15:45.336
Yeah.

15:45.516 --> 15:47.799
I can never get it past the bunker on the third hole.

15:47.819 --> 15:50.623
Try letting it go just below the mark on your drive.

15:51.324 --> 15:52.045
Hey, I know you.

15:52.165 --> 15:53.547
You're the kid that rakes my lawn.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.650
No, I'm the kid who hit you in the head.

15:56.030 --> 15:56.491
With a rake?

15:56.891 --> 15:58.113
No, with a golf club.

15:58.393 --> 16:00.136
You've been raking my yard with a golf club?

16:00.156 --> 16:01.097
I want my quarter back.

16:04.021 --> 16:04.742
Hill residents?

16:04.962 --> 16:07.005
Dad, guess where I am?

16:07.238 --> 16:08.339
I don't know, let's see.

16:08.479 --> 16:11.542
Crushing Dwight Yoakum's voice box with my five iron?

16:12.263 --> 16:14.846
I'm at Willie Nelson's, and he wants you to come over!

16:15.206 --> 16:17.548
Son, you're teasing the gorilla in the monkey house.

16:17.869 --> 16:18.689
Willie Nelson here.

16:19.290 --> 16:21.893
Practically blind in one eye now, but I got your son here.

16:22.813 --> 16:24.475
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Nelson.

16:24.795 --> 16:27.778
Bobby's never stalked anyone before, and he's not very good at it.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.381
I mean, well, he shouldn't be stalking anybody.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.503
I'll come get him right away.

16:44.735 --> 16:45.196
Bobby?

16:45.837 --> 16:46.197
Bobby?

16:46.237 --> 16:48.221
Outta my way, rooster boy.

16:52.688 --> 16:53.129
Betsy?

16:54.771 --> 16:55.272
What the?

16:56.234 --> 16:57.015
Hey, Dad!

16:57.035 --> 16:57.496
Hey, Hank.

16:57.896 --> 16:59.338
Bobby's been telling me all about you.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.004
I hear you're a guitar player, and that you got a narrow urethra.

17:03.305 --> 17:03.766
Bobby?

17:04.246 --> 17:05.769
Yeah, and he had me autograph your guitar.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.472
You signed my guitar?

17:07.972 --> 17:10.236
To my number one fan, Willie Nelson.

17:11.279 --> 17:17.507
The fox chases the rabbit around the tree trunk and gets into the house.

17:19.549 --> 17:19.849
I was so close.

17:19.869 --> 17:20.490
Hill residents.

17:20.771 --> 17:21.832
Peggy, you'll never guess.

17:22.212 --> 17:23.574
I'm at Willie Nelson's house.

17:23.914 --> 17:26.077
He says we're all invited to his barbecue.

17:26.097 --> 17:29.561
Gee, I'd love to come, Hank, but Ann Richards and I are doing our toenails.

17:29.902 --> 17:30.863
I don't think so, Peggy.

17:30.923 --> 17:34.527
I'm looking at Ann Richards right now and she's playing tetherball with one of my roadies.

17:34.968 --> 17:35.989
See, that was him.

17:36.470 --> 17:39.193
Oh, my lord, what do I wear?

17:39.781 --> 17:41.204
Peg, where any old thing?

17:41.545 --> 17:45.433
Oh, just don't forget to bring Betsy's orange woven shoulder strap.

17:46.455 --> 17:48.258
Betsy sure is a beaut, Hank.

17:48.278 --> 17:49.641
I think Trigger's getting jealous.

17:49.962 --> 17:51.004
Well, thank you, Willie.

17:51.385 --> 17:52.908
Sure means a lot coming from you.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.872
You know what they say?

17:54.892 --> 18:00.203
I'd sell my wife before I'd sell my guitar.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.804
I tell you what, man, you did that dang ol' mid-mid-midst of the tambourine, man.

18:04.824 --> 18:10.511
Somebody did come play a song for me, you know, then you got to change your name to Zimmerman, y'all born again.

18:10.571 --> 18:16.798
Well, a whole bunch of kids coming around and, hey, mad dog, ten of them going platinum.

18:16.938 --> 18:20.442
You know those accounting firms and that dang ol' boomer.

18:21.163 --> 18:24.307
Uh, ma'am, you're gonna want to angle that glass.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.970
Uh-uh, you're blowing it.

18:27.451 --> 18:30.975
You're gonna get nothing but foam.

18:30.995 --> 18:31.135
Mm-hmm.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.611
You know, Mr. Hopper, I just loved you in that movie.

18:37.971 --> 18:40.214
You know, the one where you played a mad villain.

18:40.234 --> 18:42.136
Come on, Peggy, you wild thing.

18:42.416 --> 18:44.639
Let's drive straight down to Mexico, huh?

18:44.659 --> 18:45.800
Come on, right this minute.

18:46.441 --> 18:47.021
Mexico.

18:47.702 --> 18:50.105
I wonder what a wife goes for down there, huh?

18:50.125 --> 18:51.567
One guitar, two guitars.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.932
I will have to ask Hank.

18:55.952 --> 18:58.254
Los Mariachi's so deablos.

18:58.474 --> 18:59.956
He's not treating you right, Peggy.

19:00.517 --> 19:02.539
A delicate flower like you.

19:02.587 --> 19:04.371
You want me to kick his ass?

19:05.152 --> 19:07.277
Oh, you are so sweet to offer, Dennis.

19:07.838 --> 19:09.542
But Hank would flatten you out like a bug.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.831
No, this is something Peggy Hill has to handle on her own.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.534
Oh yeah!

19:15.554 --> 19:16.817
Haha, you go girl!

19:21.347 --> 19:22.890
That's some boy you got there, Hank.

19:25.756 --> 19:27.919
Well, it's nice of you to say that, Willie.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.443
But Bobby's got no direction in life.

19:30.783 --> 19:31.544
No heroes.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.308
When I was his age, I worshipped you.

19:34.949 --> 19:37.192
And Jesus, of course.

19:37.212 --> 19:38.594
Ever think you're too tough on the boy?

19:39.135 --> 19:39.736
Oh, I don't know.

19:40.236 --> 19:48.268
Just today, he chipped Betsy's bridge, ran into my truck with the mower, dinged up my favorite wedge, and then dinged you up worse.

19:48.568 --> 19:49.750
Well, now hold on there, Hank.

19:49.770 --> 19:50.471
You think about it.

19:50.731 --> 19:55.678
Bobby wants to play your guitar, ride your mower, and swing your golf club.

19:55.658 --> 19:59.283
I believe that kid does have a hero, and his name is Hank Hall.

20:00.064 --> 20:01.006
Uh, Hill.

20:01.566 --> 20:02.087
Uh, yeah, right.

20:03.008 --> 20:03.329
Bobby?

20:05.071 --> 20:05.392
Bobby?

20:06.193 --> 20:06.573
Bobby!

20:06.634 --> 20:07.675
What?

20:07.695 --> 20:14.565
I just want to, uh, thank you for helping me meet my hero and having him sign my guitar.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.768
I helped him put Whiteman in his eye.

20:17.168 --> 20:21.835
Now I'm gonna show you something you can do with a guitar that doesn't involve cheese.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.944
This is a song I wrote a long time ago.

20:30.893 --> 20:33.237
Well, I know a gal with the purdy legs.

20:33.817 --> 20:37.283
She's a gal who can fry my eggs.

20:37.303 --> 20:41.090
And her name is Peggy.

20:42.352 --> 20:48.582
Well, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, Peggy.

20:49.169 --> 20:51.231
my pig leg.

20:52.272 --> 20:56.475
Well, I love you and I love you, Peggy Pig.

20:56.495 --> 21:00.619
Well, uh, then it just sort of goes off into a buddy holly riff.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.321
Oh, Hank.

21:02.601 --> 21:06.044
Peggy, oh, I didn't realize you were there.

21:06.524 --> 21:08.266
Here, Bobby, go practice.

21:08.286 --> 21:09.747
Are you sure it's okay for me?

21:09.767 --> 21:09.947
Yeah.

21:10.688 --> 21:13.831
You know, I was headed over here to knock you six ways from Sunday with that guitar.

21:14.351 --> 21:17.674
Then I get here and you're playing that old song years and

21:18.582 --> 21:20.305
out.

21:20.325 --> 21:25.876
I love you, propane man.

21:28.601 --> 21:35.494
You braided that perfect lumen, but next time lighten up a little on the glitter spray.

21:42.359 --> 22:03.673
He's got hold of this a little longer before we go ahead.

22:03.693 --> 22:05.556
Now?

22:05.576 --> 22:09.683
That's a good start.
