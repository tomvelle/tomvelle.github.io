7777	9119	Hey, look at that.
15367	17831	Well, I guess we're finally getting some new neighbors.
23118	30668	I tell you, if that boy handles the football half as good as he handles the cardboard box, Arlen High's got herself a new tight end.
31589	33432	Hey, you think the dad's a good bowler?
33892	35354	Yeah, he looks like a good bowler.
35554	37497	Maybe he needs someone to bowl with.
38067	40634	Notice how he lifts with his legs.
41155	43321	I think they're gonna fit in just fine.
43963	44625	Howdy fellas.
45126	46350	What brings you to Ireland?
46370	49478	Well, uh, this family hired us to move their stuff.
92742	93803	Well, I'll be damned.
94244	95745	They look Japanese.
95886	96126	Nope.
96586	97888	I think they're Chinese.
98328	99089	How can you tell?
99430	104255	Japanese guys usually have glasses and a suit and a tie and stuff like that.
104696	105396	Uh-huh.
105416	107078	Well, a neighbor's a neighbor.
107539	108900	Let's go over and say hi.
109381	111403	You reckon they even speak English?
111704	113005	Yeah, man, them Chinese, man.
113025	114687	You can't understand a word they say, man.
114707	117450	They just try to listen to the whole upside down whatnot.
119017	120880	Hi there, I'm Hank Hill.
121280	124645	I live next door, which means I'm your neighbor and you're my friend.
125607	128812	I think you'll find we have a great little community here.
129413	130795	What do you think of it so far?
131436	133278	I am Khan, Super Newsome Bone.
133979	137485	Hmm, so that's pronounced... Khan, right?
138146	138827	Nice to meet you.
141951	144315	What the hell are you trying to do?
146557	148900	So are you Chinese or Japanese?
149381	152686	I lived in California last 20 years, but first come from Laos.
153306	153967	Huh?
153987	154468	Laos.
155169	155790	We lay ocean.
156050	156871	The ocean?
157212	157973	What ocean?
158113	159054	We all lay ocean!
159315	160556	From Laos, stupid!
160937	162880	It's a landlocked country in Southeast Asia.
163180	164882	It's between Vietnam and Thailand, okay?
165303	167025	Population, 4.7 million.
169148	172513	So are you Chinese or Japanese?
173675	174957	That is so very exciting.
175458	181547	It's like we get to travel to the Orient without having to worry about diarrhea or being jailed for our pro-democracy beliefs.
181587	191183	You know, at the beauty academy, they teach us that people aren't black or white or yellow or red, but their hair can be.
191523	193727	I'm going to invite our new neighbors to dinner.
194307	196611	We can't expect them to break the eyes.
196760	199527	These people are by nature shy and reserved.
199547	205061	I read somewhere that the Chinese language has 72 words for us, but no word for friend.
206525	208069	Howdy, you all.
208673	209534	Howdy, howdy, howdy.
210155	210275	Yeah.
210675	211657	Can you believe this crap?
212217	214320	You want to live in this country, learn to speak English.
214640	215321	I'm not going.
215601	216623	But you promise.
216983	217484	Why go?
217524	220808	I could just stay home, order a bucket of chicken and watch Hee-Haw.
220988	221649	Same thing.
221909	225033	Khan, please, for once, try not to piss off neighbor.
225333	226555	We kick out of Laos.
226795	228217	We kick out of Anaheim.
228437	229599	I'm tired of running.
233263	234124	Hello, Khan.
235302	236684	Oh, damn.
236924	237364	Damn.
237845	240068	Oh, you have damn fine house.
240448	242070	Lead-free since 1988.
242310	245614	This is my wife, Meen, and daughter, Con Junior.
246035	248037	And this is Peggy Hill.
248758	253003	On behalf of Arlen, Texas, I would like to welcome you to our country.
253724	256687	Now, please make yourselves at home and take off your shoes.
257228	257468	Wait.
257969	261333	You just shampoo carpet?
261353	262254	Come on, Bobby.
262294	263215	Have some seconds.
263255	264837	The girl's lapping you.
265019	267082	I've never had beef chop suey before.
267422	267863	Really?
268424	269365	Oh, you poor dear.
270306	275554	You know, I read somewhere that in certain parts of China, meat is as scarce as toilet paper.
275894	277216	Well, where you read that?
277617	278498	Oh, who can remember?
278778	282383	You know, as a substitute teacher, I have to review all sorts of learning materials.
283024	284246	My beat was on a placement.
284566	285608	So you're a teacher?
286709	289373	Maybe you can tell me why art and test scores are so low.
290434	291155	I know why.
291195	294520	It's because Khan Junior not there to bring up average.
294989	300555	You know, my boy here might not be the best test taker, but he's got near perfect attendance.
300735	301416	Tell him, Bobby.
302798	305841	I hope you all save some room for my famous apple brown Betty.
305881	308864	The recipe is a closely guarded family secret.
309325	312188	Passed on from my mother's mother to my mother to me.
312748	314891	And someday, I will give it to my Bobby.
316733	318735	Well, at least the brown Betty was good.
318867	320229	You must give me recipe.
320810	322813	Oh, man, you know I can't do that.
323313	325536	But what I can do is offer you some leftovers.
325977	327960	Here, now just reheat this for 10 minutes.
327980	330584	I have already said way too much.
331305	333307	Well, y'all come back now, you hear?
333348	335771	That's Texan for Sayonara.
336632	338174	Oh my, Peggy here.
338495	341659	What big feet you have, like boat.
341679	343542	Well, that's just the way God made me.
347268	348973	Hey, look at me!
348993	350879	I'm like little girl in mama's shoes!
352123	355253	Okay, bye-bye now, bye-bye!
355313	357700	Now, honey, she didn't mean anything, bud.
357781	361206	You do not come into a woman's home and insult her fate.
361246	362247	You just don't.
362268	363369	Oh, come on, Peg.
363730	366153	Remember when you first moved here from Montana?
367095	369658	He called Pops so depop.
369678	372422	And you thought 93 in the shade was hot.
372963	374766	Our new neighbors are just like you.
374806	379052	All they need is a little bit of time and Hank Hill to watch out for them.
379472	381555	Well, do you think my feet are too big?
382337	384700	No, there's just more of you to love.
385810	386732	Ow.
387073	387414	Sorry.
395953	396795	Be careful, Bobby.
396835	399381	That's one of them Chinese fighting dogs.
399395	401158	Oh, it's a West Highland Terrier.
401418	402660	Yeah, that's it.
402681	403582	So what's his name?
404103	404443	Doggy.
404864	406707	Yes, Con Junior, he's a doggy.
406727	408170	Now, can you tell me his name?
408470	409292	He's called Doggy.
409833	413278	And that's called a doggy too, but her name is Lady Bird.
413759	416063	She's a purebred Georgia bloodhound.
416564	418507	Her momma tracked down James Earl Wraith.
420290	420651	Yeah!
420671	421993	Uh, aren't kids great?
422513	426041	They're too young to know about fear or prejudice.
426061	428407	They won't have to learn that till high school.
429088	432276	Yep, there's a real lesson here for all of us.
432296	432978	Move, please.
433178	434481	You're standing on my hose.
439642	443767	Dad, look, Lady Bird and Doggy like each other.
443787	444908	Of course they do, son.
444948	445589	They're neighbors.
446290	449534	You know, Con, I just found a breeding partner for my Lady Bird.
449934	454259	If you're interested in having a real American dog, I can give... What the hell?
454419	455220	Get him off!
455240	456662	Get him off of her!
456842	458704	Your Lady Bird!
458724	459765	She's real slut!
459785	461728	Lady Bird is not a slut.
462288	463009	She is in heat.
463530	467134	Her hormones have overwhelmed her natural modesty.
468312	471198	For Pete's sake, would you tie up your dog?
471498	472380	You tie your dog?
472661	473642	She seduced my doggy.
473903	474705	That's ridiculous.
474765	478452	Lady Bird can only love another purebred Georgia bloodhound.
478893	480456	You know what I think, Hank Hill?
480857	482480	I think you a narrow-minded redneck.
482740	483321	Oh, I get it.
483642	486548	Just because I'm from Texas, I gotta be some kind of redneck.
486949	489514	Chinese and their stupid stereotypes.
489534	490776	Get out my property!
494317	495319	Sorry, Lady Bird.
495760	503974	I know you didn't mean to, uh, have relations with that dog, but I gotta tie you up anyway, if only to protect your virtue and good name.
514493	516156	Well, hey, look there.
516372	519617	Maybe Con will let you borrow his sexy little import.
519637	524305	I'd cut my entire quarter acre with the lady bick before I'd borrow that man's mower.
524886	525867	I just don't like him.
526248	526549	Why?
526869	528091	Because he's Chinese?
528331	528612	No.
529013	529854	It's always great.
529894	531917	What the hell's the difference?
531937	533179	I don't like the man.
533360	535443	That has nothing to do with where he's from.
535543	536925	I'm no redneck.
536945	539089	He could be from Mars for all I care.
539369	542835	Believe me, Hank, if Con were from Mars, you'd care.
542815	548906	Especially after he's stolen every last drop of earth's drinkable water to transport back to his home planet.
550729	551250	Mars.
552713	553955	Come up, stop dawdling the wind.
554135	557341	We've got to pick up that pizza before the cheese gets cold and the pineapple gets hot.
557682	558664	What's the rush?
559164	561128	If we're not there in 30 minutes, it's free.
564010	564591	Peggy here!
564831	566113	Peggy here!
566133	567215	Wait, Peggy, it's me.
569098	569198	Stop.
569218	570460	Oh, my man.
570480	572383	I almost did not see you there.
572423	573985	Peggy here.
574005	576930	I feel deeply, deeply sorry about dinner.
577391	578713	We get off to bad start.
579113	580956	I see things I should only have thought.
581594	582255	Oh, Min.
583036	583557	Thank you.
584519	587063	I mean, it must have taken a lot of courage to apologize like that.
587504	588105	And I know.
588466	590229	I was once the new girl in town myself.
590589	590910	Me?
591150	591611	Khan?
591811	593955	Khan Junior have a barbecue tomorrow.
593975	595778	It means so much if you come.
595958	597120	Well, thank you, Min.
597161	598483	We would be honored to come.
598863	604513	And if you need any help with the barbecue, or if you just want to know what a barbecue is, you give me a call.
607379	608300	Uh-uh, Peggy.
608561	609241	I can't go.
609382	609762	I won't.
610403	612426	Not after what he said about Lady Bird.
612766	614008	Oh, Hank, come on.
614408	615790	Now, Min and I just made up.
616131	616912	We have to go.
617292	621357	And if you stay home, people will think you don't like Conn just because he's Oriental.
621538	622619	That is ridiculous.
623020	625483	I hate the man because he's rude and nasty.
625963	629148	Not because of what his people did to us in WW2.
629168	630429	Well, Hank, I know that.
630770	633994	But everyone else, they'll say Hank Hill is a racist.
633974	638362	What the hell kind of country is this where I can only hate a man if he's white?
638482	644072	Hank Hill, you will go to that party, you will pretend to like con, and you will drink until you actually do.
648260	648861	Go on.
650984	652708	Uh, howdy, Conn.
652728	653850	Howdy, howdy, howdy.
654211	654772	Here you go.
655594	660464	I thought you might enjoy 7.5 gallons of pure premium propane.
660845	661366	Are you kidding?
661987	663250	No, I cook with mesquite.
663892	665635	Give meat a nice taste of wood.
665655	666998	And I cook with propane.
667379	669123	Gives meat a nice taste of meat.
669323	670225	Thank you.
670289	671070	Hey, whatever.
671230	673933	Some cultures like mesquite, some prefer propane.
674353	675755	Doesn't mean we can't all get along.
676255	681321	Just because I happen to sell propane and propane accessories... Okay, all right.
681381	682562	Go stick tank on the table.
683003	684324	Keep napkins from blowing away.
684524	685926	Con, super news upon.
686667	687528	Ah, okay.
688168	691472	You honor me by giving me gas.
691532	692453	Doggy's just like me.
692973	695436	He's new in town and he's only got one friend.
696327	698010	But at least you're not tied up.
698451	701777	If I were, I'd just dislocate my shoulders and slip out of the knot.
702277	703459	I'd chew through the leash.
704000	706124	I bet it tastes just like a Bible cover.
707306	709009	Hey, let's untie them.
709350	710392	They belong together.
710432	712776	And it's fun to watch them play piggyback.
713537	714599	There you go, boy.
714619	716242	Go play with Lady Bird.
716602	718065	Be with your true love.
723378	724303	Wait!
724323	725247	Come back!
725267	732021	You're in love!
733486	735970	Oh look, it's Piggy here, my new best friend!
737632	740196	She's so pretty in her little yellow sundress.
740617	742780	Oh man, you are so sweet.
743080	746165	I could just mix you up in some jello and eat you for dessert.
746826	748729	Oh Piggy here, look at husbands.
749049	751233	Too bad men don't get along like we do.
751493	752475	We get along?
752955	754077	Man, stupid.
754057	758685	Women's smart mm-hmm the whole world over hey Peggy here.
758945	761329	Look what I make Peggy here brown Betty.
761369	763413	Oh, but that's impossible.
763473	768040	I never gave you the oh Where'd you get my granny's recipe?
768060	774631	I figured out myself and then make it better her recipe missing one thing Flavor I thank your Pete.
774651	777496	I add flavor not make flavor now tastes much better.
777516	778798	Don't you think Peggy here?
779403	781025	Please try a Piggy Brown Betty.
781286	783369	Would you like a Piggy Brown Betty?
783389	783609	It's tasty.
783629	784150	Delicious.
784591	789458	While Piggy, to be honest, I have always had trouble keeping your brown Betty down, but this here is pure heaven.
792683	794426	Those burgers look pretty done to me.
794486	795307	Not yet.
796269	797691	You might want to turn them now.
797971	798592	Too soon.
799073	799514	Okay.
802518	805663	Uh... Whoa.
807955	809517	You might want to turn them now.
809577	810378	No.
810398	811178	Please go away.
811339	812820	Please, Con, you're burning them.
812860	814222	That's too much char.
814322	820568	Shut mouth and open mouth.
820588	820648	Oh.
820668	820748	Hmm.
820768	821729	Boy, howdy.
822370	824993	That is the best damn burger I ever ate.
827115	828557	Stop, stop pushing.
828577	829678	That's enough for everyone.
830158	833061	If three of you go home right now, ha ha ha.
833722	834423	Joke.
834483	836105	Doggy.
836165	836545	Doggy.
837098	838039	Con Junior?
838099	838981	Yeah?
839602	841284	Why are you named Con Junior?
841765	842926	My father wanted a boy.
842967	844529	Yeah, so did mine.
844949	846011	My dad is so lame.
846472	848675	He makes me practice violin five hours a day.
848995	852060	My dad won't let me watch TV more than five hours a day.
852320	856206	Well, my dad's making me memorize 2,000 words for the SAT.
856706	857948	He's such an autocrat.
859170	861233	What's a SAT?
862141	865966	I tell you, Peggy, there's nothing these people can't make better.
866706	870651	First the automobile, then the color TV, and now the hamburger.
871192	872093	How do they do it?
872313	874356	With a dash of nutmeg, Hank.
874376	875497	A dash of nutmeg.
875877	876678	Oh, Peggy here!
876979	880002	Your husband likes burgers so much, I give you a recipe.
880303	881504	Now you can please him.
883426	888212	I don't care what country he's from, any man who can make a burger like that is okay by me.
889073	890595	Oh, you said it.
891301	896228	Boy, it was so good, it's almost a shame to lose it to the process of digestion.
896409	899113	Yeah, man, I'll tell you what, the dang old onion soup powder, man.
899133	902097	Just put that little bit old ab you don't need old grilled onions, man.
902278	903259	How about you, Dale?
903299	904621	How many you got under your belt?
904982	905503	Zero.
906043	906164	Huh?
906584	907005	How come?
908367	909629	Don't eat dog.
916099	916720	Okay.
917260	920245	Here are the facts as I see them.
920377	921618	Khan served your dog.
921879	923901	Khan did not serve us dog.
924301	926264	That's just an awful stereotype.
926484	928426	Chinese people don't really do that.
928686	929227	Well, I don't know.
929707	932651	Anyone crazy enough to put nutmeg in brown Betty?
932991	934713	Well, they'd be crazy enough to do anything.
935514	938938	Hey, even if they did feed us dog, you know, who are we?
939258	941140	Who are we to judge other cultures?
941200	942722	You know, maybe they're on to something.
944407	946009	They did invent paper, you know.
946249	947330	Quit talking like that.
947831	949512	Dog is man's best friend.
949532	951474	You wouldn't eat your best friend, would you?
951494	952555	Of course not.
952575	955138	Wait, are we talking about some kind of lifeboat situation here?
955158	957080	Because I don't want to paint myself into a corner.
957300	958962	Look, I can settle this right now.
959222	960684	That woman gave us a recipe.
961605	961845	See?
962085	962526	Right here.
962546	965008	It says chopped meat, not chopped dog.
965349	966430	Dog is meat.
967831	967891	Mm.
967911	968812	You said it, friend.
970754	971755	Oh.
971976	974278	I was just trying to get that awful taste off my fingers.
988805	989225	Doggy?
990327	991068	Doggy?
991088	991588	Hello?
992009	992690	Dog pound?
992890	993691	Yes, hello?
994612	996394	I'm looking for dog.
996414	997936	Sweet, sweet dog.
998356	1000839	Have big barbecue today and dog run out.
1001620	1003302	All about 20, 25 pound.
1003662	1005024	Good lord, it's true.
1005905	1007347	Oh, I'll call you back.
1007387	1008348	Hey, Kill.
1008368	1009569	What a nice surprise.
1009950	1011111	Hey, Khan, come quick.
1011251	1012613	Your best friend is here.
1013053	1013454	Oh, no.
1013994	1014996	Uh, that's OK.
1015396	1017158	What are you doing here?
1019230	1021834	I can't hear you over my weed, Parker.
1022395	1023997	Hey, where you going, kiddo?
1024017	1024578	Stop!
1024919	1025680	I can't hear you.
1026180	1027082	My good tentamom!
1027843	1028945	What you doing?
1029325	1030667	You ruined my yard!
1030747	1032129	You crazy redneck!
1032149	1033011	That's a niff!
1035334	1037057	We're never gonna find Doggie.
1037077	1038219	I know.
1039100	1040021	Wanna ride bikes?
1041203	1044187	Hey, Lady Bird's a bloodhound.
1044448	1045850	Maybe she can find Doggie.
1046271	1047212	Yeah!
1047597	1048989	Come on, Lady Bird.
1049110	1052258	Lead us to Doggie.
1066025	1067527	My God, Dale, you were right.
1067727	1068789	Their dog is gone.
1069290	1069871	All gone.
1070071	1073195	I caught men on the phone with some kind of doggy butcher.
1073476	1075298	She was placing an order.
1075318	1076700	This is very dangerous.
1077061	1078142	They know that you know.
1078383	1079885	And now they gotta come after you.
1080165	1080626	They do?
1080846	1081067	Yep.
1081507	1083170	They'll probably get you with a blow dart.
1083310	1084051	That's their way.
1084311	1086154	But you'll just think it's a mosquito bite.
1086394	1088958	Until you die, then you'll know the truth.
1088978	1089358	Why?
1089459	1090640	Why would they shoot people?
1090680	1092543	Human meat's tough, flavorless.
1092563	1095407	They should be out hunting for more dog.
1096720	1099704	Good God!
1099945	1105393	He's got Lady Bird!
1105413	1106354	It's still wet.
1106715	1107716	Maybe there's time.
1108297	1110340	Come on guys, we gotta save Lady Bird.
1114165	1114906	Gah!
1114927	1115628	I've been hit!
1116148	1116769	Quick!
1116789	1118712	Somebody suck out the poison!
1135583	1136457	Oh no!
1136599	1137696	Lady Bird!
1139650	1141071	Whoa.
1141091	1142753	That psycho Redneck is back.
1143193	1144214	Why, he's so mad.
1144955	1145756	You do something wrong?
1146136	1147898	You're the one who insulted his propane.
1148258	1150861	You're the one who made fun of Peggy Hill's monster feet.
1151401	1152722	Open up, Con.
1152742	1153583	Open up now.
1153943	1154584	Get my bat.
1155044	1155965	I know you're in there.
1156025	1157186	Go away.
1157207	1158548	I do nothing wrong.
1158748	1166675	Look, Con, I understand that life is valued differently in your part of the world, largely as a result of overcrowding and famine.
1167396	1169438	But you're in my country now.
1169418	1170559	You're a crazy man.
1170839	1171760	I call the police.
1171780	1174422	If anyone's going to be calling the police, it's going to be me.
1174863	1175323	Police?
1175784	1176744	What do you want from me?
1177525	1178946	I want my lady bird.
1179247	1180167	You understand me?
1180508	1182269	Give me my dog back or else.
1183390	1183911	Oh-ho-ho-ho.
1184291	1184911	Tough guy.
1185372	1186173	I'm so scared.
1186473	1187694	You want a piece of this?
1187714	1188595	Dad, no!
1188775	1189676	It's all our fault.
1189776	1190917	We lost the dogs.
1191217	1195621	They wanted to play with each other, so we untied them, and they ran away, and now we can't find them.
1195881	1196522	You what?
1197262	1198243	You mean you...
1198578	1201081	The, the dogs, they're still alive?
1201501	1202683	What do you think happened?
1202703	1204885	Well, I, uh, nothing.
1205186	1206347	We're sorry, Dad.
1206447	1207749	We looked everywhere.
1208029	1209030	We really did.
1209391	1211693	Bobby, you really screwed up this time.
1211854	1214417	Con, Junior, you fought in with a bad crowd.
1214477	1216259	You made me fight with my neighbor.
1216319	1218081	You made the neighbor man crazy.
1218121	1219142	Go to your room!
1221245	1223387	What, you say, go to your room?
1223603	1225827	I say, go to your room.
1226508	1227009	You spank?
1227370	1227931	No, sir.
1228351	1229253	Don't believe in it.
1229494	1230596	No, me neither.
1230616	1231597	I think it barbaric.
1232058	1233901	How about bed without dessert?
1234262	1236065	Never fail.
1236085	1236165	Huh.
1236186	1240894	Wouldn't figure a child could be motivated by a fortune cookie and an orange slice.
1241375	1245983	Oh, the cookie may be small, but it contains great wisdom.
1246486	1248208	And orange is sweet and juicy.
1248228	1255037	You know, Con, we may deny our kids completely different desserts, but they both go to bed hungry.
1255618	1257941	And that's what really matters.
1257961	1261666	Well, I guess we're not so different after all.
1262688	1263529	Boy, howdy.
1263549	1263689	Woo!
1264050	1266132	Woo!
1266152	1266233	Woo!
1266253	1267875	Woo!
1267895	1268195	Woo!
1268456	1269156	Woo!
1269857	1269938	Woo!
1269958	1270038	Woo!
1270058	1270138	Woo!
1270158	1270238	Woo!
1270258	1270338	Woo!
1270358	1270438	Woo!
1270458	1270538	Woo!
1270558	1270638	Woo!

1270759	1270839	Woo!
1270859	1270939	Woo!

1271359	1271460	Woo!
1271480	1271560	Woo!
1271580	1271660	Woo!
1271680	1271760	Woo!
1271780	1271960	Woo!
1271980	1272140	Woo!
1272160	1272361	Woo!
1272381	1272461	Woo!
1272481	1272561	Woo!
1273773	1279423	Welcome to the neighborhood, con su panusan pon.
1279443	1280325	Just call me con.
1280866	1285675	I don't got all damn day.
1285695	1286957	I'm running out of time.
1287298	1290263	Give me the antidote, man.
1302055	1304659	This is my granny's five alarm jambalaya.
1307464	1311350	You want less hot, more spicy, add nutmeg.
1311370	1314094	Less hot, more spicy, add nutmeg, of course.
1314114	1314495	Okay.
1315356	1316818	Aunt Laverne's chicken fried chicken.
1318401	1322187	Too much Mrs. Dash, add nutmeg.
1322968	1325652	And this here is my very own rabbit stew.
1327615	1328096	Rabbit?
1328437	1329919	You rednecks will eat anything.
