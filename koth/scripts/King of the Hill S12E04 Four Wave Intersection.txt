Oh boy, another day of triple digit temperatures.
Now it's official.
This heat wave has lasted longer than my second marriage.
So wherever you are, Rhonda, this song goes out to you.
Oh, too hot.
Can't make it to my house.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
Well, I'll be.
I guess that makes it official.
It's summer, all right.
Is it me, or did it just get a few degrees cooler since Boomhauer walked out?
Oh, man, that old breezy, man.
Man, that's a straight cut.
Will you do me a half-shirt?
Nice Daisy Dukes.
Bobby, have you seen my... Joseph, isn't it time you think about heading home?
I can't take it in my house.
My dad has the heat cranked all the way up.
He said something about fighting fire with fire, but it wasn't working for me.
Quiet!
Look!
Get wild, get wet, get cool, goop-a-nah-nah.
Ooh.
And the water's gone wild, all the San Pedro exit.
Take the second left, arms and the needle full of oars.
Now featuring the Big Couture, the hardest, coolest wave in Texas.
Goop-a-nah-nah.
We have to go, Dad.
Will you take us?
Please.
Yeah, you gotta take us, dude.
I'm starting to leave a butt puddle.
Fine.
Just put on your pants.
No!
That's not good at all.
Hank Hill here.
Hank!
It's Bill!
I got a flat on the bypass!
It's hot.
It's hot!
It's so hot!
You gotta come get me!
Fine.
Dang it, now I gotta go pick up Mr. Dottrieve.
Do you kids remember the exit to the water park?
Take the second left off San Anita Avenue.
No, dude, it's slight left on Ansonita Boulevard.
No, it's get wet, get wild, get cool, go banana.
Off the San Pedro exit.
It's right there.
Thank God.
Where's Hank?
I can't take it!
Help!
I need help!
They're waving at me!
They're really waving at me!
I'm waving at you!
And you!
And you!
Hello!
Do you guys hear that?
That's water!
Look how high that slide goes!
That's the avalanche, and it's horrifying.
Some kid went on it, and all that came out the bottom was a bathing suit.
They never found him.
I heard, in the middle of the slide, there's a moment where you're traveling so fast you actually become water.
Three tickets, please.
Would you like to get summer passes?
No.
Please, Dad!
If you won't do it for me, do it for your lawn.
A slip and slide can be very destructive.
Okay, but this is your entire summer entertainment budget.
Don't come to me in a couple of days and say you're bored of the water park like you did with the French horn lessons, the karate lessons, and spy camp.
I won't.
I'll be too refreshed to bother you.
Hey, man, don't air-hawkey, man.
Who want to take on a champ, man?
Let me see what you got!
Hi there!
Have a nice day!
Well, your tire's fixed.
You can get out of here now.
In a minute!
Oh!
I got a school bus coming!
Hey there, children!
Bill, it's over 100 degrees out and you don't have... How do I say this?
You don't have many health assets.
You should get inside.
It is a hot one today, I'll tell ya.
Too hot for pads.
Yikes, I gotta work with this guy, people, and he's serious about taking off his pants.
I have, but I'll tell ya, one resident of ours was offering this community a little relief from the heat in the form of a kind cool wave from the side of the highway.
People toss around the word hero, but this guy's a real hero.
I don't know his name, so I guess we can only call him the Heat Waiver.
Thank you, Heat Waiver.
They talked about me on the radio.
I matter.
Take that, dad!
Thanks the kid for the commercial.
Andy's going bananas.
Visor dude, you're in.
Yeah.
Hot girl, you're definitely in.
What about us?
Why don't you kiddies hit up the tad pool and get out of here?
Locals only, mothers!
Get off our way!
Maybe we should go.
No way.
I didn't spend my entire summer budget to slide down a little frog tongue.
Can I help you?
Oh, thank goodness, an adult.
We won't arrive, but they won't let us.
I see.
And I guess it sucks to be you.
What?
I have a summer pass and I demand to cool down and get wet.
Hey, Harky.
These kids want to get wet.
You know what that means.
Yeah, full on, Bodie.
Welcome to the Avalanche.
You must ride feet first, with your arms crossed over your chest.
Don't do this!
Ride this wave, Granny.
I think he just turned into water.
They wouldn't let us ride because we weren't locals.
Locals only?
That's the most insane thing I've ever heard of.
Nobody lives in an amusement park.
That is so weird.
Because I always have really good experiences with surfers.
Didn't they help put your sunscreen on, Poppy?
No.
I got it.
I have found that bullies are actually very insecure.
Tomorrow, tell him he has a nice smile and he will become your best friend.
I'm not going back.
They specifically told me not to.
By the way, I'm gonna need some money for them all.
No you don't.
We're going back to that water park and I'll deal with those locals.
Not all surfers are bad Bobby.
I read in a magazine about a girl surfer who was attacked by a shark and against all odds, she still managed to be pretty.
Happy holiday!
It's almost Friday!
Buckle up now!
Stay cool, Ireland!
Welcome to Big Water!
Can I point you to the gift shop?
No.
My son wants to ride on your endless wave, but some giblet heads won't let him.
They're giblet heads!
And the last time I checked, this was America.
USA!
That is terrible.
I will take care of this immediately.
Big Water may be owned by Germans, but we have very American policies when it comes to customer service.
Well, alright.
Excuse me, Bodie.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Of course, Tim.
What's up?
Tell him what's up, Tim.
This kid's daddy just came and talked to me about you guys.
I just call him dad.
Dang it, Bodie.
I don't ask any questions about what goes on on Coconut Island.
Now, I'm leaving this boy in your hands and I don't want to have to come back here.
In fact, I'm not coming back here because I trust that you'll take good care of the situation.
Yes, sir, Tim.
Wait, wait, Tim!
Don't leave now!
Tim!
Yep?
Yep.
Oh, now, man.
What are you kids doing back already?
The locals messed with us again.
I go to get the kids and those punks throw me down Avalanche too.
And they disrespected my half shirt.
What happened to the manager?
That manager made things worse.
I got thrown down the Avalanche naked.
Joseph, why didn't you help him?
Because I ran away.
Nicely done.
I'm never going back to that park again, so long as there are surfers.
Maybe you could talk to those guys, Boomhauer.
Boomhauer used to be the best surfer in Corpus Christi.
Nah, I don't know about that, man.
What do you mean?
You're amazing.
King of the beach, a golden god on a wooden board.
No, I'm not too bad.
You know, little... Do you really think you could talk some sense into these guys, Boomhauer?
Of course he could!
Wow!
Look how stable he is!
Is this even surfing?
I think he's kayaking!
Bill, what are you doing out here?
You look terrible.
We gotta get you inside now.
That won't go!
I have a responsibility to the people of Ireland!
Stop looking at me like that, Peggy!
Stop it!
Yeah, I've surfed all the big waves, six flags, bush gardens, even tarruptively world.
That's in Malaga, Spain.
Yeah, right!
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, man, come on, there you go.
Just tell us when it's safe.
Hey, bros, check out this hoedad.
What are you looking for, brah?
I'm talking about little kids, man.
You're going to let them kids ride, man.
I'm talking about one surfer to another, man.
If you're really a surfer like you say you are, then you'll do your talking on the wave.
That's the only language I comprende.
Comprende.
Check it out, Harky!
You order a picnic table?
This old dude's confused.
Your short should be long, and your board should be short.
You got it backwards, Broham!
Do you have a shorter board, Mr. Boomhauer?
Hey, man, it's like I said, that thing was surfing, surfing, man.
You show him how we do it in Ireland, Mr. Boomhauer!
Do they have air conditioning at the library?
Use it or lose it old friend.
You lose it.
So just the two of us today, huh Hank?
Yep.
So it's just me and you then, just two men drinking together, not in a group.
I'm gonna go check on Bill.
Yes, go get Bill, great idea.
Bill, it's Hank.
I just wanted to stop by and see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm feeling much better.
I'm getting back on the road, Hank.
Absolutely not.
But I'm the heat waiver.
You're not leaving this home.
Oh, the burns.
My skin hurts.
Okay, okay.
I won't get back out there today, but you gotta do something for me, Hank.
What?
Be my arms.
Wave for me, Hank.
Wave to everyone, especially the old people and children.
Wave to the children, Hank, and only give the thumbs up to Truckers.
You'll do that for me, won't you, Hank?
No.
Then I have nothing more to say to you.
Just please do it now!
Hey Bobby, how was the surf today?
Did Boomhauer do his famous flamingo?
That's when he stands on one leg.
That's not easy to do even on the ground.
No, all he did was fall flat on his face and embarrass himself and us by association.
We didn't even get to ride the wave.
Boomhauer was embarrassed?
I don't know what the heck's going on here, but someone needs to get their asses kicked.
Finally.
Yes.
Thank you.
It's time to kick their local asses.
Bobby language.
But yes, I am going to kick their asses.
you
Hey man, that's a dang old good set, eh?
Yeah, brah.
You're paddling out?
No, man, you know, just like a dang old dog, man.
Can't help it.
They got them new tricks, man.
Shaw, brah.
Do wave, man, you know.
Can't help but beat it, man.
Yeah, can't beat the wave, brah.
Beat the surfer.
Beat the surfer?
Another hot one today.
Too hot for me and apparently too hot for the heat waver.
It appears that the heat has beaten the heat waver.
This heat waver is stuck a knife into the hope of the commuters of this city and twisted it.
We would have been better off had he never shown up with his teasing of cool kindness.
Check this Barney and the Wranglers.
They say no rodeo, bro, dad!
Well, it certainly isn't.
At the rodeo, people have talent and treat each other with respect.
Yeah, respect!
You have to earn respect.
Yeah, you must be bodied.
And you must be a pud.
Listen, man, if you wanna surf... I didn't come here to surf.
Well, what'd you come here to do?
To kick your ass.
I bail!
Hey man, I won't take it from here, man.
No.
No more talking.
No more surfing.
My dad's finally going to set things right on Coconut Island.
Hey man, this is my time, man.
You can't surf.
You're old.
And you're not going to surf.
Talk about holding down and beating the surfer, man.
I wouldn't do that, son.
The Flamingo!
The Flamingo!
Ah, crap, man.
I don't need it, man.
Some amazing news, Justin, from the Slappy Van.
The heat waver is back!
The heat waver is back!
There just might be hope for this town after all.
Say no rodeo bro dad!
