28837	29358	Yep.
31581	32062	Yep.
34586	34906	Yep.
37110	39573	Mm-hmm.
39593	40775	You know what it could be.
41576	43079	That damn starter motor.
43900	45242	You're getting good compression.
45943	46323	Yeah.
48106	49428	I know what's wrong with it.
49989	50830	It's a Ford.
50870	53955	You know what they say Ford stands for, don't you?
54356	56599	It stands for fix it again, Tony.
57659	59703	You're thinking of a fiat, Dale.
60685	63251	Fix it again.
66919	75617	I'll tell you what you do, you just take them dang old spark plugs out, and then that little hole, you just put a little hole around there, just like Bobby Hunter says, I could go boom, boom, just like that.
77352	79975	Well, I wish it were that simple, Boomhauer.
80415	82598	But I'll tell you what my truck really needs.
83299	83919	Leadership.
84700	92389	Detroit hadn't felt any real pride since George Bush went to Japan and vomited on their auto executives.
92409	92950	Who's ready?
99197	101419	Y'all catch a Seinfeld show last night?
101669	102691	Yep.
102711	104033	Oh, hell, I missed it.
104053	110544	I'll tell you what, you see that part where Daniel George come in there and talk about tasting his own burp and cream or come sliding in.
110685	111987	I always do that.
112488	113470	I'll tell you what, man.
113930	115393	Them dang old New York boys.
116615	118378	Just to show about nothing.
147130	154059	Whatcha listenin' to, son?
154480	155782	I don't think you like it.
156042	156603	Well, why not?
157043	159166	I like this new generation of music.
161709	164313	Hello?
164333	166856	Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.
167357	168599	Where did you record this?
168919	170020	I bought it at the mall.
170141	171923	It's a funny phone jerks.
172021	173222	Let me tell you, Bobby.
173382	175745	There's nothing funny about these sounds.
176265	179969	What that person on your tape has is a medical disorder.
180469	182211	Now, you get ready for the game, okay?
182931	183532	Yes, sir.
184533	185674	That boy ain't right.
188276	188857	Oh, God!
189417	191039	Luanne, I thought you went home.
191499	193662	No, Uncle Hank, Mom and Dad are still fighting.
194202	198706	Well, you're welcome to stay, but for God's sakes, girl, lock the door.
199147	201589	I've got a minor son living in this house.
204252	207638	So you ready to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?
208379	209681	Okay.
209701	211224	Nah, don't you worry son.
211284	212506	You just do your best.
212867	214269	Don't listen to her, Bobby.
214750	218356	If you want to win, you're gonna have to do better than your best.
218656	219959	How do I do that?
220379	221521	You gotta give 110%.
222303	225668	That's what'll give you that winning edge.
226029	229635	But what if the Wildcats give 110% too?
229835	231737	Well then you gotta try even harder.
231997	234339	How about if Bobby gave a hundred and twelve percent?
234760	236041	Uh, sure, that'd work.
236962	239364	Or maybe a hundred and thirteen.
240925	242507	Yeah, yeah, that's even better.
243107	246210	No, I don't know, thirteen is a very unlucky number.
246350	248593	Look, we're not talking about thirteen.
248713	254718	We're talking about a hundred and thirteen and even... Okay, give a hundred and twelve.
254798	255699	What's the difference?
256180	258762	Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?
262117	262958	Swing, Bobby!
262978	263398	Swing!
263579	264079	Swing!
264520	267163	And y'all the dang ol' dick lone apt at ball one.
267383	268545	Good eye, honey, good eye.
270567	271928	Oh, for crying out loud.
274251	280158	Bobby, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs and you can't get on base without taking a swing.
280659	282581	The pitcher could walk me, couldn't he?
283582	285524	Don't play lawyer ball, son.
285805	287787	Now you hit the next one out of the park.
299140	300762	Look at the batter, boy.
301143	302104	Watch the ball.
302464	302865	Huh?
303626	304147	What?
304728	305869	Hey, don't look at me.
305969	307752	Keep your eye on the ball.
307992	309854	Keep my eye on the what?
310095	311376	Stop looking at me, boy.
311617	312478	Watch the ball.
313119	313960	Can't hear you, Dad.
318586	319467	Don't worry, Bobby.
319487	320529	You played a good game.
321710	326717	I got to stop in here for a minute and get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.
335033	336154	I hate this place.
336895	339259	Excuse me, where's the hardware department?
339739	343184	Where is the hardware department?
344445	345687	What exactly is it you're looking for?
345707	347449	The hardware department.
348090	350313	Yeah, but are you looking for like a tool or something?
350634	352076	What difference does it make?
352937	355580	Huh, what difference does it make?
355600	359185	Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die and some WD-40.
359384	360526	Huh.
360546	361747	What is it that you're trying to do?
362048	368577	I'm trying to buy a tap and die and some WD-40 and get out of this God-forsaken store.
369177	370199	Ah.
370219	371260	And what is it, tap and die?
371501	372402	Okay, forget it.
372923	374345	Let's say I want a hammer.
374725	376107	Do you know what a hammer is?
376528	377349	That's what I want.
377469	378450	A damned hammer.
378771	381274	Now where in the hell would I go?
381254	384323	Hey, that's that Hank Hill fella that lives on the block next to us.
384343	385606	He sure has a temper, doesn't he?
385827	386388	Sure does.
386910	388695	Makes you wonder who gave his boy that black eye.
390219	392164	Uh, you're gonna have to pay for that, dude.
392485	393508	You're fired!
394501	405233	You say he hit his son with a bat?
405313	414343	No, that is definitely not acceptable.
415545	419489	I wish I could, ma'am, but the regulations say we can't take custody of the boy without an interview.
420690	422132	Don't you worry, he's in the system now.
422472	423934	I am on my way.
426563	430387	Hey, I know what's wrong with your truck.
430688	433191	It's your quote-unquote pollution controls.
433671	435834	I heard on talk radio you don't even need them.
436074	438236	They're just an egghead government plot.
438256	441780	How is cutting down on pollution a government plot, Dale?
442121	443522	Open up your eyes, man.
443923	445965	They're trying to control global warming.
446186	446546	Get it?
446866	448128	Global.
448849	450090	So what?
450070	455516	That's code for UN commissars telling Americans what temperature it's going to be in our outdoors.
455717	460662	I say let the world warm up, see what Boutros Boutros golly golly thinks about that.
461503	463205	We'll grow oranges in Alaska.
463826	465528	Dale, you giblet head.
465848	466930	We live in Texas.
467490	473157	It's already 110 in the summer, and if it gets one degree hotter, I'm going to kick your ass.
475059	478423	What in God's name is that thumping sound?
479669	481533	Bobby, why don't you go out and help your daddy?
482035	483979	You have been watching way too much TV, son.
485022	485322	Come on.
485503	486686	Come on, Bobby, up.
486706	487407	No more TV.
487828	488390	Turn it off now.
491257	493322	Oh, God, I love that poor man.
494304	494444	Oh!
496730	497050	There.
497471	498133	That's better.
506838	508860	Hello, I'm a social worker with the state.
509260	511042	Would you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
511222	512183	Well sure, come on in.
513765	515246	Dammit, there it is again.
515847	517609	Where is that thumping coming from?
518049	519210	It's driving me crazy.
520211	521833	Could be far off helicopters.
522574	524816	You in helicopters.
524836	526017	Dale, what are you doing?
526097	526878	Give me some light!
527338	528860	Now, I can't see!
530201	531483	My arm!
531503	531663	My head!
532203	533064	Ow!
534305	535967	Ow!
536285	539008	Mrs. Hill, would you say your husband has a bad temper?
539228	539869	Who, Hank?
540490	542512	No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.
545035	547498	No more bouncing that ball!
548119	549300	Hank, we have a visitor.
554406	558611	So your assertion, Mr. Hill, is that Bobby got the black eye at his baseball game?
558931	560733	That's not my assertion.
560913	561874	That's what happened.
562595	564077	Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill?
564377	564958	No.
567368	569050	What the heck are you writing?
569571	571273	All you got to write is one word.
571413	571694	No!
572174	575399	Mr. Hill, I feel that you're coming from an anger mindset.
575799	582528	And if you're projecting this anger onto me, it gives me grave concerns as to how you facilitate your son's growth in private.
582789	586534	Mr. I have not begun to project my anger onto you.
587375	589678	Mrs. Hill, how did you get this here on your forehead?
590058	590479	Oh, this?
590519	591921	Well, Bobby threw his baseball at you.
591941	593823	You threw a baseball at your mother?
593843	595806	Oh, Hank, it was an accident.
596883	600048	So would this be the same baseball that gave Bobby the black eye?
600088	604875	Uh, Dale, you sure you want to be messing with Hank's truck when he's not around?
605235	607318	I'm gonna help get him this alternator off.
608540	611644	Uh, Dale, I think you released the brake cable.
612145	612766	Dale!
612986	616471	No, I didn't.
616491	617973	I guess I better get going.
618835	620477	I got some edging to do.
623022	624643	Do you work outside the home, Mrs. Hill?
624663	625764	Well, yes, I do.
625784	627566	I'm a substitute Spanish teacher.
628207	630669	Losestudiantes son, me saw me ghost.
631049	632230	And you just have the one son?
632531	632851	Uh-huh.
633391	637975	Yeah, well, we would have liked to have more kids, but Hank has a narrow urethra.
638136	638496	Peggy.
638736	640358	In fact, Hank's sperm can.
640378	641098	That's enough.
641679	643841	What in the hell did you tell him that for?
644221	645062	Well, he asked me.
645222	647204	He asked you how many kids we have.
647264	649146	He didn't ask you about my glands.
649666	650567	Please, Mr. Hill.
650967	653029	Loud is not allowed.
653009	653410	What?
653991	655474	Loud is not allowed.
655955	657278	Now you listen to me, mister.
657920	662550	I work for a living, and I mean real work not writing down gobbledygook.
663271	668723	I provide the people of this community with propane and propane accessories.
668703	686664	Oh, when I think of all my hard-earned tax dollars, going to pay a bunch of little twig boy bureaucrats like you, it just makes me wanna... Oh, God, it just... Honey, bring me my BC headache powder and a glass of water.
687185	687927	All right, Hank.
688565	689546	Now you listen here.
690027	691108	You see that boy?
691528	692649	That's my boy.
693030	699377	And if you ever try to take him away, so help me, God, I'll tear you a new one bigger than the Grand Canyon.
700078	702700	Now I want you to get out of my house.
702720	703802	You're not welcome here.
704482	707085	I mean now, before I give you a black eye.
707666	713813	Get... You wanna know about ol' Hank?
713833	717036	Well, Hank's got a lot of problems.
717320	718221	Hey, baby!
718622	719963	How about a couple of beers?
720564	721285	Sorry, should.
721325	721866	Gotta go.
721926	724069	I got another migraine treatment with John Redcorn.
724529	729716	Nancy, you've been going to that healer for 12 years and you still get headaches every night.
729976	731659	Healing process takes time, honey.
735063	738467	Getting back to the Hill family, have you ever seen Hank hit his child, Bobby?
738748	739088	Hank?
739529	740190	No, sir.
740270	741972	Bobby's his pride and joy.
742553	745116	Cause of his narrow urethra.
746395	747438	Are you absolutely sure?
747458	748380	100%.
748821	749924	You can ask my son.
750325	751568	He's Bobby's best friend.
752129	752730	Joseph!
753372	754294	What is it, Daddy?
754836	756339	You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?
756740	757763	No, I never.
758284	758545	See?
760008	761552	Now you can just move along now.
761853	764315	I've been calling y'all people for better than a month now.
764336	766918	Grabbed a shower every time a dangled dog crossed the street.
766958	770081	Started y'all 24 hours a day, and nobody answered.
770101	772984	You had called, asked if I was supposed to come out and do anything about that dog.
773004	777569	If you're just gonna get a dangled computer, ain't gonna come over here and shut that dangled dog up.
777589	781973	And then some weirdo came over and was asking us a bunch of questions.
782334	783194	Yeah.
783215	785217	He asked me if your dad ever whooped you.
785677	786698	He hasn't, right?
786958	787859	Of course not.
787939	788940	You know my dad.
789020	790662	He's all bark.
790793	792635	Boy, that guy got him mad, though.
792956	799805	My dad was like, get out of my house, my boy ain't much, but he's all I got.
801847	803369	He did great impressions.
804250	804971	Let me try.
804991	808075	I'll tear you a new one.
808516	816266	When I get my hands on you, you little pea brain, I'll bust your butt into little pieces.
816826	818168	Oh, I knew it.
819363	822286	Good God, Peggy, this was on the road and track.
823066	823727	Luann!
824187	825929	Luann, honey, can we talk to you?
826309	828051	Wait, wait, not while I'm here.
828111	830653	Mama's in jail.
831234	840903	She was saving a quart of beer for before bed, and daddy threw it out, and she went after him with a fork, and the trailer tipped over, and everything went upside down, and it's all gonna be on real stories of the Highway Patrol.
841543	845267	And the wig I styled for Beauty Academy is ruined.
846428	848610	What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?
848928	850690	There, there.
851531	858740	You can stay with us till your mama comes home and you'll style a new wig better than before.
860182	861483	I'll let you use my tools.
862444	864447	Oh, thanks, Uncle Hank.
866589	867671	She has got to go.
871335	871655	Bobby?
872296	873157	Bobby, are you all right?
873338	873858	Come on out.
874199	875901	I thought I told you to get lost.
876141	877062	Come on, Bobby.
877430	882515	I can put you with a nice foster family in North Ireland where you can develop healthy life adaptations.
883176	884097	And they've got a pool!
884457	885999	Honey, let's give him Lou Ann.
886499	889042	Hey, I got a girl in here you can take right now.
889422	891624	Don't you want to live in a house with a pool?
892305	892605	No.
893066	893987	See, twig boy?
894027	896870	Now get your skinny butt off of my property.
897170	900433	Bobby, I know you can't talk in front of him.
900653	901494	I said get!
901975	902255	Get!
902635	903236	Get out of here!
904017	905278	You are out of control!
905338	907200	You're out of control, twiggy!
907180	914308	Thanks for the latte, Kenneth.
914889	917171	Anthony, could I see you a minute?
917191	918573	It's on this Hill family case.
919354	923539	You couldn't confirm any actual abuse, but you still recommended the state take custody?
924119	924600	Oh, yeah.
924620	926582	I mean, the whole neighborhood was Redneck City.
927043	929926	Did you see in the report how he dented my G.O.?
929946	930607	Redneck City.
930867	931548	That's pretty funny.
932189	932990	Where are you from, son?
933430	933951	Los Angeles.
935032	935112	Hmm.
936070	938154	And see here, hit by baseball.
940419	942503	So, how did you like old Harvey?
944207	944628	Who's Harvey?
945189	946251	Oh, he's a little league coach.
947173	949658	You did talk to the little league coach, didn't you?
955510	958233	Son, have you lost your mind?
958253	958574	Wait!
959134	962078	Dad, you're not supposed to yell at me anymore.
962499	969387	The guy from the state said, your hostility invalidates our parent-child contract.
969407	971910	You're quoting that twig boy at me?
972110	973252	Hi, the neighbors.
973592	978759	Remember, he said loud is not allowed, Dad, or they'll take me away.
981141	981602	Oh, God.
986948	987449	Hello?
987729	988830	Is this the Hill residence?
989511	990252	Who am I talking to?
990772	991513	Bobby Hill.
991953	994276	Well, son, this is the state social services.
994676	996839	We're calling off our investigation of your father.
997399	1000983	The workers that visited you will be leaving the office and going back to LA.
1001684	1004847	Now, you please tell your parents we apologize for the misunderstanding.
1005168	1006429	OK, I'll tell them.
1006909	1007230	Bye.
1007670	1009692	Bobby, who was that?
1009712	1014998	Uh, wrong number.
1017155	1030949	I borrowed your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.
1031069	1034232	It wouldn't start at first because you had a clogged fuel line, but I have a little bit clean.
1038576	1040959	Hey Bobby, go plug this in the garage for me.
1041519	1042200	Okay.
1047142	1048664	Wanna see something cool?
1052862	1053783	What in the heck?
1053983	1055145	Don't you see I'm working here?
1055245	1056386	Close the dang door!
1057607	1059029	Bob, just keep put!
1059049	1059369	Stop!
1059549	1060751	Stop hitting that button!
1060931	1061772	Give me that thing!
1062092	1066237	Dad, that's not respectful adult child growth dialogue.
1066397	1071142	I'll give you dialogue that's not coming from a center of anger.
1071663	1076989	Please return the garage door to its factory preset down position.
1079632	1081654	That is cool.
1088063	1093710	Please, uh, respect my fences right to be a fence.
1094651	1111793	Now!
1113747	1117871	What on God's green earth are you making those noises for?
1118052	1119233	There's sound effects.
1119513	1121155	Like that guy in police academy.
1121495	1123097	That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up.
1123197	1123878	I decided.
1124178	1126020	And dad can't say boo about it.
1126541	1129984	Bobby, a man from the Child Protective Services just came by.
1130585	1135090	Now, he said that he told you last week that this investigation was off.
1136531	1139234	Oh, please don't tell dad.
1139675	1140776	Well son, I have to.
1140856	1141797	He's been worried.
1142080	1143784	But I like him better this way.
1144305	1144726	How come?
1145107	1147754	I can make him love me even when I screw up.
1148796	1149899	Is that what you think?
1154029	1154991	It's hard, Peggy.
1155933	1159482	I don't want to lose my little boy, my only son.
1159883	1160985	But, oh, it's hard.
1161525	1162827	Well, you can relax.
1163168	1165511	The investigation has been off for a week.
1166072	1167714	Only Bobby didn't tell us.
1167995	1168676	I'll kill him!
1168796	1170018	All right, calm down, honey.
1170058	1170979	Now, let me explain.
1171500	1172822	He didn't do it to be mean.
1173263	1176007	Bobby honestly doesn't think that you love him all the time.
1176267	1177048	That's crazy.
1177088	1177829	Of course I love him.
1178130	1178671	Very good.
1179051	1180373	Now, say it to Bobby.
1180538	1181539	What are you talking about?
1181859	1185584	I want you to tell Bobby that your love for him is unconditional.
1186124	1187165	Well, I can't say that.
1187726	1188207	I can't.
1189008	1190509	You know how I was raised.
1190950	1192311	What my father's like.
1192812	1196436	I got my shin blown off by a Japan man's machine gun.
1196956	1201141	So don't come crying to me with your problems.
1201161	1202443	Honey, I'm begging you.
1202803	1204965	For the sake of this family, you have got to do it.
1205586	1207288	He's waiting for you out on the porch.
1207522	1208644	Oh, jeez.
1209144	1228753	That twig boy comes over here and gets... Uh... You, uh... You're my son, uh... Well, you know, with everything, uh... That entails, uh... Uh...
1230590	1239062	You know, feelings of fondness and more... You know what I mean, don't you boy?
1239082	1240424	No.
1242907	1246793	Well, that's a hell of a weird sound.
1246833	1247914	I never made that before.
1251119	1253983	You... family.
1256927	1259010	You're not making this easy on me, boy.
1260863	1262405	Okay.
1262425	1263706	I love you no matter what you do there.
1263947	1264167	Phew.
1264807	1265969	Let's go get something to eat.
1267050	1270954	I'm not just a big disappointment to you.
1271455	1273077	Disappointment?
1273097	1274719	No, you make me proud.
1275420	1278984	I've been disappointed by just about everything else in this town, but you?
1279604	1280205	Not once.
1281006	1283409	Damn it, you're my boy.
1283429	1284610	You know better than that.
1286480	1287788	He punched him!
1287808	1288130	I knew it!
1288312	1288754	I told him!
1288815	1289700	Did you see that?
1290103	1291331	See what, big boy?
1292740	1293283	Never mind.
