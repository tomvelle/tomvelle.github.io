Yes, I do know the temperature.
Outside temperature is 98.6.
My body temperature is 63 degrees.
Wait a minute.
Out of way of working man, I try to get home.
Con, even old lady Matlow can drive down the alley without asking anyone to move.
What's that say about you?
I leave for work when you're sleeping.
I come home when you're drinking.
What that say about you?
So the man likes to drink, so what?
It say you not get promotion.
Same old job for you.
Great new project for Con.
Come with company car.
Inflatable side curtains almost make you want to crash.
I don't need a promotion.
As assistant manager of Strickland Propane, I'm already at the top.
Yeah.
Okay.
I leave you to think about that one.
Game set and match.
Hank Hill.
Heineken or Beck?
Beck!
Duck or light?
Duck!
Beck, duck!
Oh, shoot, I gamble and lose.
Just have Heineken and Beck light.
No duck beer for new system manager of coordinated project systems?
Oh, God!
It is finally yours!
Do you remember your last promotion?
We had passed on bait all night long.
Make love to me.
No!
Ha ha ha!
Oh!
Boy, howdy!
Where's Redneck?
So, Con, you need some propane?
Haven't they replaced you with a coin-operated machine yet?
Just give me your tank.
I need it filled to the top this time.
No more screwing me.
I have big party tomorrow to celebrate my promotion.
I knew Systems Manager.
Systems Manager?
Well, hell, I like the sound of that.
Debbie, that's your new title.
No!
She's not in Systems.
You disrespect important job.
Well, I can't imagine anything more important than what Dibby does.
So, uh, so what kind of systems do you manage, Con?
Like a phone system?
I can't tell you.
We have big army contract.
So, Con, these phones that you answer, do they sit on a big fancy desk like in a lobby, say?
Hank, you come to work with me.
You see, it humble you.
No, I don't think so, Con.
You see, we have phones right here in the office.
I'd give you a tour.
Maybe we give you a big propane contract.
So you're looking for a propane contractor?
Well, you know, we at Strickland Propane believe that... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'd be big clients.
You sure you can handle this by yourself?
Maybe I need more senior redneck.
Uh, no, I... I... Got me there, Conn.
We at Strickland Propane believe that...
So, if you could tell me a little bit about the company's propane needs, then I can- It's all mine, Hank.
Private office.
You've got such a bug in your bonnet above phones?
Check this out!
I call France on this phone whenever I want!
France, Europe, Huckleberry!
No window?
Haha!
What's security?
Look at this computer!
Fastest processes in the world!
You gotta do your own typing, huh?
Okay, you come with me.
Hank, you tell anyone about any of this stuff.
They will hunt you down.
You don't have the clearance.
Nobody trusts you like they trust me.
Now, prepare your brain for Razzle Dazzle!
Con, I don't have to play golf with you to sell you, because propane hits a hole in one every time.
Whoa!
Company created most resilient ceramic composite ever.
Army want to use it on all new tanks.
We put it on his golf club.
Bango!
Bargle 400 yards every time!
You try.
Go ahead.
Take a swing.
Impressive?
Yeah.
Ha ha!
You impressed with Khan's great job!
Huh?
No, no I'm not.
Too late!
You say it!
Baha!
You impressed!
I win!
Now, get off my company's property!
If this is your way of negotiating, it's working.
Now, I'm prepared to offer you a 5% discount per gallon.
No one want your dinosaur gas.
This whole place run on underground fuel cells that's safer and more efficient.
You mean this whole time?
Yeah, I thank you all afternoon.
You know, this can never get back to Khan, but after swinging that club, I literally felt like dancing.
You know, in Japan, around the golf cost $12,000.
You play from rooftop to rooftop.
The balls are made out of rice somehow.
And when you're all done, you gotta go home and sleep in a tube.
You know, I work in the military, and I have never even heard of that club.
Hank, you ever have any regrets that you didn't go into systems?
Well, if I couldn't sell propane, like if I hit my head and went dumb and just couldn't be trusted with it, then, yeah, I might consider going into systems, though.
The wind was really against you in the back nine, General.
No one could drive through that.
You did.
If you're gonna suck up, make some sense of it, man.
Well, General, you should try that new club with the special ceramic you're developing with the composite company, 400 yards every drive.
That's what I hear.
Didn't you all know about the club?
Maybe I shouldn't have said nothing.
We're gonna use that stuff on our tanks.
Private Taylor is gay.
Con, we're terminating your contract.
It's a business call!
I swear!
I pay for it, just bill me.
Khan, you broke your security agreement.
Vacate the building within four minutes.
Please.
I didn't say anything to anybody.
Aw, dang.
Hey look, there's a taxi.
Company car trouble, Con.
Hank Hill, you sell me out.
You blab secrets everywhere and I get fired.
I didn't.
Dale, are you posting our conversations on the internet again?
Conversations, no.
Actions, whereabouts, your moment schedule, no comment.
See, Con, nobody told anybody anything.
I was having a casual conversation with the general.
I didn't know we were on the record.
Hank, I can fight on you?
And you go tell your dog?
They were your secrets for you to keep.
Now, I'm sorry you were fired, but it was your own fault.
You sorry for Khan?
Khan's sitting pretty.
I got 7th package bigger than a year of your... Your salary.
Yeah.
Jokes on him.
I don't even make a living wage.
Hey, Peggy, did you hear?
Khan lost his job.
Boy, it's just awful.
Well, systems is like that.
It's a crazy business.
Why'd you do it, Hank?
Do what?
Oh, good Lord, Hank.
Everybody knows you can't tell Bill anything.
Hey, don't try to make me into the bad guy.
Khan's the bad guy.
He leaked government secrets.
He's lucky they didn't shoot him.
You know who's responsible for gossip?
Gossipers.
You are nothing but a chatty-cathy hank.
A giant 200-pound chatty-cathy.
Hi.
I heard Khan lost his job and that reminded me I still hadn't returned your bowl.
Well, thank you for dropping by, Peggy Hill.
But we're gonna be just fine.
Something like this only make us appreciate how many things we have.
How many, many things.
Just look around you.
Take your time for Peggy Hill.
Savor.
Like you in museum.
Well, very, very nice.
Oh, bread maker.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, fruit processor.
Oh, ceramic panda.
What do you know?
Well, when you need a shoulder to cry on, I am just across the yard.
As Doyle Harkavy says, shoulders make the best tissues.
I fill out form.
I unemployed.
Where my check?
I'm sorry, sir.
Your past employer apparently has filed an objection.
Let's see here.
Under reason for dismissal, they checked other and then wrote in treason.
Where my check?
I'm sorry.
Next.
Shackleford, rusty.
Here you go, Mr. Shackleford.
Thank you.
Well, all right, Con.
You know, you almost look good enough to sell propane.
You got a job interview already?
You need interview.
I got job.
Good job!
In repro-graphic imaging industry.
Hey, man.
I'm having a concert this Sunday.
Could I put up one of my posters in your window?
Get out before I three-hole punch your face!
Help, I'm stuck.
Mayday!
Well, well, well, how the mighty have fallen.
Anyhoo, this is what I'm trying to do.
Combine my logo with a personal message.
Do you know how to work paintbrush?
Wait!
First, I need you to swear that what you see here goes no further, given your history of blabbing about every top secret thing that comes your way.
I can't help you.
I can't help any of you stupid people.
How does this machine work, Mr. Khan?
How do I print?
How do I save?
It controls S-humorons.
It's always controls S. All right, that's three strikes, Khan.
You're fired.
Three?
That's only two.
I heard what you said to Mr. Mangione.
Oh, yeah.
See, the man can't keep a job.
It's his personality, not me.
Does this mean Connie's broke, too?
They have all got nothing, Bobby.
Connie, too?
Nothing.
That's why I've asked men to teach Laotian to Bobby.
It's a way to give them money without humiliating them so terribly.
Well, I suppose we could throw a couple of bucks his way.
And, uh, I mean, two bucks.
Bobby, there are only four tone markers in the Laotian language.
Four.
That's not so bad.
And 42 continent and 35 vowel and vowel clusters.
Oh, Bobby, pretty soon we'll have a secret language we can speak in school.
No, Connie.
I teach him Southern dialect.
He not the same class.
Hey, flabbermouth!
You break it, you buy it.
Peggy here!
So glad you came.
Let me show you what design clothes look like.
Maybe you're interested.
Con, I love this ceramic panda marine radio.
How much?
It too much for you.
No price is too high, just name it.
Seven hundred dollars?
Sold.
I mean eight hundred.
Sold.
No, I take this off the market.
Delicate equipment, not for redneck.
Con, you sell him that stupid panda.
We need the money.
No.
Yes, you sabotage our sale.
Gribble make a check out to me.
With pleasure.
And your name is...
Now nobody buy it.
Happy?
Everyone get off my lawn.
Off.
And stay off.
All right, turn hose on you.
Man, where my hose?
You went quickly.
The man attacked his own garage sale, Peggy.
He's gone insane.
Thank you, you have to understand.
Conn is well aware that he has been reduced to the status of a cafeteria worker.
And you, my dear, you put that hairnet on his head.
Peggy, is it my fault he makes people hate him?
I don't whisper in his ear every morning, be a jerk.
That comes from within.
Dad, can I have 15?
No, my gal.
For my lotion lesson?
Ni-gin bak gao better not mean dollar.
That's it.
Hello, men.
Where's Khan?
Bushel threw bathroom door.
He locked himself in.
Well, nothing wrong with that.
You're supposed to lock the door.
It helps avoid embarrassing mishaps.
He's not talking to me.
Oh, excuse me.
Things right now.
You know, this is not the first time Conn fired.
Orange County, Portland, Mississippi for God's sake.
Well, the severance that Conn told me about... Oh, there's no severance?
Hear me?
Conn leaked the secret, broke the contract.
We get nothing.
We left our paycheck to paycheck, and now we broke it in a stone.
Listen, Peggy and I have just been marveling at Bobby's progress with Lay Ocean, so...
Well, I thought I'd pay for ten lessons up front.
Yeah, good idea.
What you doing?
We are not charity case.
Yes, we are.
You make us one.
Oh, so now it's my fault.
I fired.
I'm out of here.
Yep.
I gotta go.
What was that about?
That was a series of vowel clusters.
Please tell me I never looked that bad.
Well, Khan's been gone for three days and hasn't so much as called.
I'll bet he's on an adventure.
Well, it's not him I'm thinking about.
I mean, what would you do if Dale just suddenly left you high and dry like that?
Oh, sure.
I wouldn't get out of bed for a week.
Why don't you go help her out, honey?
Well, the neighborly thing to do is to keep our distance.
Need a hand there?
Oh, I surrounded by trash.
Khan used to say that when he looked at neighbors.
Well, if there's anything else you need.
Refrigerate and make terrible noise.
It will break any second.
Guthers are clogged, bedroom door stuck, long, wild like jungle.
Come, get your ladder.
Come on, Hank Hill.
So, Hank, I certainly have noticed how helpful you've been to Min.
Yeah, and I told her I'd seal her driveway tomorrow.
But what about drinking in the alley?
Yes, exactly.
I can't get this time back.
I'm just trying to do the neighborly thing, like you said.
Well, just try to keep in mind that we don't like them very much, remember?
It's like he's got two families.
Two families, I think that's unfair when some of us don't even have the one.
I'd think he likes being bossed around by women if I didn't know better, which I don't.
Bill.
Hank.
Dale.
Hank.
Boom higher.
90.
Oligomist.
Men, uh, I think what you need is a new compressor cable right here, preferably a copper one.
Saul, how would I get that part?
From the hardware store.
That kind of far away, right?
Yeah.
I'll pick one up for you.
I was going to head over there myself.
Just for fun though.
Is that
Where the hell have you been?
Looking for new wife sent you by mine.
I was just paying her for lay-ocean lessons.
And you know what I'm doing now?
Buying a part for your damn refrigerator.
Not in there!
I got shirts soaking in walleye.
Con, go home and take care of business.
I not go back without new kick ass job.
I show you.
I get job that make you cry every day.
Look, Con, I love propane through and through, but okay, I'll give you this.
Your old job was something else, okay?
Now go home.
No!
I can't fail!
It's not supposed to happen to me.
I'm Asian for God's sake.
More expected of me.
You not understand.
You somebody's worker bee.
If I accept your redneck life, it like I bury myself alive.
What about men and Connie?
You're my best friend.
You take care of them.
I'm your best friend?
No, I take it back.
Nobody takes care of them.
Time's hard, but men's a fighter.
They be okay.
Why you keep watching me, you pervert?
Somebody get the manager!
Noi.
Noi.
No.
Noi.
Noi.
No.
Noi.
Bobby, dinner's ready.
Oh, uh, by the way, I accidentally picked up an extra bucket of chicken on the way home if you guys are interested.
How do you know it's extra yet?
Khan, you got a lot of homesick about you ought to come back here.
I got a new job.
Make 20,000 more a year.
OK.
Maybe I'll let you back in, but you sleep on the couch.
I thought you'd be happy.
So we pack up quickly.
Job in Houston.
Oh, no.
I'm not moving again.
People here grudgingly accept us.
That's rare.
It's a three-hour drive.
Not negotiable.
You commute.
Hey, neighbor!
Maybe I buy your house!
Storage for my own things!
What you think of that?
My house is not for sale.
Oh!
Then I guess I buy your bank and foreclose on you!
That's a good one, Con.
Are you laughing or crying because of my great new car?
Turbo engine, halogen light, 6 CD change are in trunk?
In the trunk?
Well, if you need a hand installing it in your dash, let me know.
It's supposed to be in trunk.
It plays CDs in trunk.
Why?
Who's going to want to ride in the trunk?
You wish you could ride in my trunk.
My trunk's so plush, it like movie star trunk.
Well, you got me there, Con.
My trunk is not like a movie star trunk.
It's just a family man trunk.
Thank you, Hank.
Prepare your brain for Razzle Dazzle!
